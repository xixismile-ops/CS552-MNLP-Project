We had the chance to talk to the thoughtful and eloquent dancer about her time with the company and goals for the future.\nWas New York City Ballet always your dream company?\nAs soon as I knew I wanted to be a professional dancer, I knew that I wanted to be in New York City Ballet. I moved to New York when I was 14 to train at the School of American Ballet, and I got my apprenticeship with the company when I was 17, so it was really a dream come true.\nKrohn and Adrian Danchig-Waring in Balanchine's Stravinsky Violin Concerto. Video Courtesy NYCB.\nWhat have been your favorite ballets or roles to dance?\nBalanchine's Stravinsky Violin Concerto, which I'll dance for my final show, has always been a favorite, as well as Balanchine's Movements for Piano and Orchestra and Agon. Also Robbins' Dances at a Gathering... there are so many, it's hard to choose! I've always really loved the Balanchine black and white ballets, and there are some Robbins ballets that are always so fulfilling.\nCan you think of a favorite moment with the company?\nAfter almost 20 years there are countless things. In general I would say the time that I've had onstage with some of my friends and dancing partners has been so special. It's one thing to be a friend with someone and another to also share the stage with them. There's just an amazing sense of trust and spontaneity; I feel so connected when I'm out there. That's something I'll never forget.\nWhat's the main way that your experience in the company has changed over the years?\nAs I was getting older the company all of a sudden started to seem younger and younger. When I became a soloist and especially a principal my relationship with the corps de ballet dancers shifted. I wanted to be someone that the young dancers could look up to; I wanted to reach out and connect to them more, and to offer support and advice.\nKrohn and Amara Ramasar in Balanchine's \"Movements for Piano and Orchestra.\" Photo by Paul Kolnik, Courtesy NYCB.\nDid you always know that you wanted to stay on with the company?\nIt had been in the back of my mind for a number of years, but I didn't really address it formally until a year ago. I spoke to Peter (Martins), just to kind of let him know what I had been thinking. I wanted to hear how he felt about it, which was actually a little nerve-wracking, but he thought it was a great idea.\nWhat are you most looking forward to in your new role?\nI'd like to nurture them and their talents; I'm always amazed to see how talented everyone is. The ballets that we have in our repertoire are so amazing\u2014it's a great honor to be able to carry them on with the new dancers for the future.\nKrohn with Robert Fairchild in Justin Peck's Everywhere We Go. Video Courtesy NYCB.\nIs there someone who's teaching style or mentorship style you'd most like to emulate?\nThere are a couple of ballet masters that I've connected to. I'm very close to Karin von Aroldingen. Her undying passion for these pieces is incredibly inspiring. Susan Hendl has also been an inspiration. She has a wonderful talent of drawing out everyone's unique qualities and femininity.\nWhat parts of your life outside of ballet do you most look forward to cultivating now that you'll have more time on your hands?\nI'm looking forward to having more time to enjoy museums in the city. While I was dancing I didn't want to be up on my legs all day on my days off. I won't have to worry about that so much now, and I can spend my day off roaming around and being inspired. I also love to cook, so I'll get to cook a lot more and hopefully host more dinner parties.\nKrohn and Company in Balanchine's \"Serenade.\" Photo by Paul Kolnik, Courtesy NYCB.\nDo you have a piece of advice for young dancers who are just starting out?\nWhat's so special about ballet is the discipline that it instills. It's important for young dancers to really understand that that is what's taught to you in ballet class every day. It's an invaluable quality for a person to have, whether they continue to dance or end up doing other things.\nMy other piece of advice is that you have to treat each day as a new start. Some days you might not feel good about yourself, or things in your body might not be working well\u2014every day is different. But you have to start fresh, be positive and move forward."}, {"prompt": "<|endoftext|> In 2014 the dance world was surprised when longtime Pennsylvania Ballet artistic director Roy Kaiser stepped down.

Photo by Walter E. Owen, Courtesy Dance Magazine Archives.\nFrom Page to Stage\nIn 1892 St. Petersburg, choreographer Marius Petipa and composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky pulled the story off the page and onto the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre. But Petipa fell ill while choreographing The Nutcracker and handed his duties over to his assistant, Lev Ivanov. Critics at the 1892 premiere were not pleased. Balletomanes felt the work to be uneven, and lamented the lack of a main ballerina in the first act. Many thought that the story was too light compared to historically based stories.\nOut of Russia\nDespite its initial reception, the ballet survived, partially due to the success of Tchaikovsky's score. Performances were scarce, though, as the Russian Revolution scattered its original dancers. The Nutcracker's first major exposure outside of Russia took place in London in 1934. Former Mariinsky ballet master Nikolas Sergeyev was tasked with staging Petipa's story ballets on the Vic-Wells Ballet (today The Royal Ballet) from the original notation. The notes were incomplete and difficult to read, yet Sergeyev persisted, and The Nutcracker made it to the stage.\nDancers from ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in \"The Nutcracker\" pas de deux.

Christensen later founded Ballet West, which continues to perform his version of The Nutcracker each year.\nBalanchine rehearsing the snow scene with NYCB. Photo by Frederick Melton, Courtesy Dance Magazine Archives.\nA Christmas Staple\nThough the ballet's popularity was already growing, some historians suggest that George Balanchine was the first to irretrievably link the work to the holidays. As dance critic Robert Greskovic puts it, Balanchine was \"responsible for making the ballet a fixture of the Christmas season and of a ballet company's repertory.\" New York City Ballet first presented Balanchine's Nutcracker in February of 1954 but quickly recognized its holiday appeal and moved the ballet to December for the following year.\nNutcracker All Over\nAs regional ballet companies sprouted around the country, The Nutcracker became a staple.Today it's a holiday tradition that keeps families coming back year after year; its mass appeal keeps ballet in mainstream culture. Many companies attract audiences by infusing the classic with their own regional heritage: Christopher Wheeldon's Nutcracker for the Joffrey Ballet is set at Chicago's 1893 world's fair and The Washington Ballet serves a dose of American history with characters such as George Washington and King George III.\nGeorge Washington in The Washington Ballet's Nutcracker.\" Photo by Carol Pratt, Courtesy The Washington Ballet.\nThe Nutcracker also serves as the financial backbone of companies nationwide. Last year San Francisco Ballet sold a total of 87,926 tickets to the holiday ballet and Boston Ballet sold a total of 92,907. Despite its humble roots, The Nutcracker is now the show that companies rely on to put on inventive and cutting-edge works throughout the rest of the year.\nMore secrets and surprises\u2026\nAccording to dance historian Doug Fullington, in the original 1892 scenario the Nutcracker has two sisters who graciously welcome Clara to the Land of Sweets with warm hugs.\nPennsylvania Ballet's Craig Wasserman in the Candy Cane variation. Photo by Alexander Iziliaev, Courtesy Pennsylvania Ballet.\nThe Candy Cane variation (danced to the Russian Trepak music) was choreographed by its original 1892 dancer, Alexandre Shiryaev. Dance critic Mindy Aloff says that Shiryaev was \"possibly the first practitioner of hand-drawn animation; he notated his choreography in sequential drawings that could be projected to show the dance in movement.\" Balanchine included Shiryaev's original choreography in his Nutcracker.\nThe ethereal twinkling sound in the Sugar Plum Fairy's solo comes from the celesta, a rare instrument Tchaikovsky heard in France. \"He had one sent to him essentially in secret,\" says Fullington.\nBalanchine was given a budget of $40,000 for his 1954 premiere and, according to Aloff, he spent $25,000 on the Christmas tree alone. When asked if he could do without the tree Balanchine responded, \"[The ballet] is the tree.\" Today, New York City Ballet's tree weighs one ton and can reach a full height of 41 feet.\n1892 \"Nutcracker\" costume sketch by Ivan Vsevolozhsky of the Sugar Plum Fairy's retinue.

She's standing among other students, but they all work alone, with the help of teachers calling out corrections from the front of the room. On top of her strong classical foundation and clean balletic lines, Pei Yu's slithery coordination and laser-sharp focus give her dancing a polished gleam. Once she's mastered the pirouette she's been struggling with, she repeats the step over and over until the clock reaches 12 pm for lunch. Here, every moment is a chance to approach perfection.\nPei Yu came to the school at age 10 from Hebei, a province near Beijing. Now 20, and in her third year of BDA's professional program, she is an example of a new kind of Chinese ballet student. Founded in 1954 by the country's communist government, BDA is a fully state-funded professional training school with close to 3,000 students and 275 full-time teachers over four departments (ballet, classical Chinese dance, social dance and musical theater). It offers degrees in performance, choreography and more. BDA's ballet program has long been known for fostering pristine Russian-style talent. But since 2011, the school has made major efforts to broaden ballet students' knowledge of Chinese dance traditions and the works of Western contemporary ballet choreographers. Pointe went inside this prestigious academy to see how BDA trains its dancers.\nGetting In\nBDA's admission process is extremely competitive, despite the school's large numbers. The ballet program is made up of a lower division, lasting seven years, and a four-year professional bachelor program.\nThe professional division's admission procedure is extensive. Every year, hundreds of students ages 16 to 18 audition in Beijing over the course of two days, presenting classical and contemporary variations and improvisational work, and taking an academic exam. \"We are looking to produce artists with the technical skills to excel in professional companies and the knowledge to work in all jobs in the field of dance,\" says the ballet department's executive and artistic director and former National Ballet of China principal Zhirui (Regina) Zou.\nNearly 100 are currently enrolled in the professional ballet program. Though the school does admit foreign applicants, it does not host international students very often because the academic entrance exam measures Chinese language proficiency (most classes are taught in Chinese). BDA does participate in exchange programs with ballet schools around the world.\nA Typical Day\nStudents begin their days with an early 8 am technique class. Following the Vaganova method, classes are strict and focus on precise positions and placement. Upper levels are split to keep class size small\u2014around eight students per class. Teachers correct individual students\u2014usually only the best ones, positioned front and center\u2014using the terms \"not good\" (b\u00f9 ha\u02c7o) and \"better\" (g\u00e8ng ha\u02c7o), but rarely awarding praise.\nThe day continues with classical Chinese dance, character, contemporary, repertoire and pas de deux, as well as dance history, anatomy, music appreciation and injury prevention. \"Classical Chinese dance is a large part of our identity as Chinese ballet dancers,\" explains Zou. She points out an example from a girls' ballet class, where students circle their heads as if in a reverse renvers\u00e9 during an attitude promenade. \"Chinese dance focuses on circular upper-body movements, a unique coordination that complements ballet technique.\"\nRehearsals and classes can end as late as 9 pm. Students live on campus in dormitories; with little free time and all focus placed on their futures, they consider BDA home until graduation.\nBDA's ballet department in a performance of \"La Bayad\u00e8re.\" Photo Courtesy BDA.\nStage Time\nPerformance is the most important aspect of BDA students' professional development, with annual productions featuring classical ballets, contemporary works and student choreography. Since dancers don't usually audition internationally, these performances are their chance to be discovered\u2014directors from surrounding Chinese companies, including the National Ballet of China, attend in order to scout new talent.\nAs a result, preparation is intense. In a studio rehearsal for La Bayad\u00e8re, Act II, no understudies are present, and any imperfection is pointed out by one of four coaches at the front of the room. All lines, heads, arms and feet are perfectly placed. Although Pei Yu sparkles in her variation, the other dancers are similarly strong and dedicated. Students run the piece twice for stamina. Between run-throughs, each fastidiously practices difficult sections, never satisfied with the results.\nDancers approach more contemporary movement with a mature coordination mirroring many professional dancers. Recent performances have included works by Paul Taylor, Jorma Elo and Christopher Wheeldon; students often get to work with the choreographers directly. Pei Yu learned Over Glow from Elo himself. \"He showed us how to handle rhythm with the whole body,\" she says. \"Ballet has so many rules, but contemporary ballet makes me feel excited and free.\"\nSun Jie, a coach and men's teacher at BDA since 2008, explains how introducing works from Western choreographers has broadened the overall abilities of Chinese ballet dancers. \"When we started to teach new works at BDA in 2011, students struggled to move freely or adapt to new movement,\" he says. \"But learning these styles over time has opened dancers' eyes to new possibilities.\"\nLife After Graduation\nBDA students enter professional life somewhat older than in the West, with graduates ranging from 20 to 22 years old. Only the most promising students receive company contracts, but others accept teaching and other dance-related posts at BDA and surrounding dance schools and institutions.\nAlthough many have won awards at international competitions, the school does not actively focus on competing. \"To prepare competitors, so much attention must be placed on individual students, whereas performances encourage the entire student body,\" says Zou.\nEven so, competitions have given these students international exposure, though only a small percentage of graduates accept jobs abroad. BDA alumni in American companies include San Francisco Ballet soloists Wei Wang and Wanting Zhao and ABT corps members Zhiyao Zhang and Xuelan Lu.\nWith graduation in sight, Pei Yu shares the same dream as many of her classmates: a spot with the National Ballet of China. P\nA men's classical Chinese dance class. Photo by Lucy Van Cleef.\nBeijing's Bournonville Connection\nExposure to the Danish Bournonville style is a special component of the diverse ballet education that BDA offers. Former Royal Danish Ballet artistic director Frank Andersen has been a guest teacher at the school since 2002, and was awarded a professorship in 2012. So far, BDA students have performed in Bournonville ballets including Napoli's Act III, La Ventana and Conservatory, and some danced in the National Ballet of China's 2015 production of La Sylphide. Thanks to almost 23 years of Andersen's work in Beijing, Bournonville has found a second home in China.\nThough there are Bournonville technique classes when time allows, Andersen imparts those lessons through the repertoire and Danish mime. \"The most important part is making the mime believable,\" Andersen explains. \"Young dancers often have the urge to overact. If I can't describe what I want with words, I have to show them.\" He holds his hands towards his chest, indicating the sign for \"I.\" \"Showing can be more effective than telling. That's the beauty of Bournonville's work. It's so honest.\""}, {"prompt": "<|endoftext|> Though American Ballet Theatre principals James Whiteside and Isabella Boylston have long displayed their envy-worthy friendship on Instagram, this week the Cindies", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Though American Ballet Theatre principals James Whiteside and Isabella Boylston have long displayed their envy-worthy friendship on Instagram, this week the Cindies took to the social media platform to share a photo of their new dance partner, the \"Dancing With the Stars\" alum and \"The Voice\" judge.\n\n\"I'm so excited to be dancing with @jameswhiteside and @isabellaboylston,\" the two captioned the photo. \"We are so excited to be dancing with each other and to be a part of the @AmericanBalletTv family.\"\n\nThe two have been friends for years, and the two have been dancing together since the beginning of their careers.\n\n\"I'm so excited to be dancing with @james", "gold_ref": "<|endoftext|> Though American Ballet Theatre principals James Whiteside and Isabella Boylston have long displayed their envy-worthy friendship on Instagram, this week the Cindies (their nickname for each other) offered viewers an even deeper glimpse into their world.

Hamburg Ballet coproduced the full-length ballet with the National Ballet of Canada and the Bolshoi, the latter of which will premiere the work March 23 (NBoC will have its premiere in November). The production will feature Bolshoi star Svetlana Zakharova in the title role. This is especially fitting as Neumeier's initial inspiration for the ballet came from Zakharova while they were working together on his Lady of the Camellias. The following video delves into what makes this production stand out.\nWorld Premieres at Richmond Ballet and Ballet Arizona\nRichmond Ballet's New Works Festival March 20-25 features pieces by four choreographers who have never worked with Richmond Ballet before: Francesca Harper, Tom Mattingly, Mariana Oliveira and Bradley Shelver.

While those outside of the cinephile community might not be familiar with McLaren's work, he is commonly credited with advancing film techniques including animation and pixilation in the 20th century\u2014he died in 1987. The Canadian artist's many accolades include a 1952 Oscar for Best Documentary for his abstract short film Neighbours (watch the whole thing here). Later in life, McLaren became interested in ballet, and made a number of dance films including his renowned 1968 Pas de deux.\nNBoC's new work, titled Frame by Frame, will run June 1-10 in Toronto. The ballet combines vignettes of McLaren's life with movement quotes from his films and real time recreations of his technological advances. It was created in collaboration by NBoC principal dancer and choreographic associate Guillaume C\u00f4t\u00e9 and film and stage director Robert Lepage, who is making his NBoC debut. Pointe touched base with C\u00f4t\u00e9 on how this interdisciplinary project came together.\nWhere did the initial spark for this idea come from?\nRobert and I have been wanting to work together for years. I approached him about doing a different project a long time ago, and he said \"well, maybe that's not the correct project.\" He came to me about four years after that and said \"I think I finally have something I'd like to work on with you,\" so then I approached the National Ballet.\nWere you familiar with McLaren's work before this project?\nI wasn't. Robert had just worked on a big McLaren documentary, and he got me to come see it and I realized that it was all about movement, and that this animator was basically a choreographer himself, a choreographer of space and time. There was all this material to work with and he'd made a number of iconic dance films, so it seemed like a no brainer. So I started my research and kept finding out more surprising fun facts about McLaren's passion for dance, like that he met Guy Glover, the man that he was in a relationship with for 50 years or so, in the audience at Covent Garden while watching a ballet. Guy was a curator of a dance festival in Canada.\nRobert Lepage and Guillaume C\u00f4t\u00e9 in rehearsal for \"Frame By Frame.\" Photo by Elias Djemil-Matassov, Courtesy NBoC.\nWhat was the research process like?\nRobert had just finished his documentary and has a really deep understanding of this kind of Canadian culture. He'd already gotten incredible footage from the National Film Board of Canada of McLaren behind-the-scenes. I watched a tremendous amount of film, and I read a lot about him and his collaborators, and even met a few who are still alive. The research was truly enriching, because I realized how wonderful of a person he was as well, which dictates how we share his personal life onstage.\nWhat was the timeline of the project?\nWe had our first workshop four years ago. Since then we've been doing five-day workshops once a year in Robert's studio, Ex Machina, where he has a multi media team. They would put together projections and props for us to experiment with. Robert would give me some homework, and I'd take it on myself to create some impressionist sections. Sometimes we decided that they were great, and sometimes we decided that they weren't. It was this really collaborative way of getting things started because I was able to present dance first, and then we were able to add technology to it, as opposed to the technology taking over and stealing from the dance.\nArtists of the Ballet in rehearsal for \"Frame by Frame.\" Photo by David Leclerc, Courtesy NBoC.\nHow does the piece balance a narrative retelling of McLaren's life with reproductions of his works?\nI would say that the vignettes of his life are one third, and then the technologies that he pioneered and making abstract dance interpretations based on those technologies like stop motion or body painting and body projection are the second third. And then the last third is basically just direct quotes from his films and bringing them back to life. Like with Pas de deux, the effects in that film took him months to make, but now thanks to technology we can duplicate it live. It's not a story ballet per say, but there is a story from beginning to end.\nWhat was the process like of taking movement quotes from McLaren's films?"}, {"prompt": "<|endoftext|> The Broadway revival of Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein's Carousel opened last week, and while it stars luminaries from the worlds of musical theater (Joshua", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> The Broadway revival of Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein's Carousel opened last week, and while it stars luminaries from the worlds of musical theater (Joshua Jackson, Tony winner Tony Award winner Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony winner Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony nominee Tony", "gold_ref": "<|endoftext|> The Broadway revival of Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein's Carousel opened last week, and while it stars luminaries from the worlds of musical theater (Joshua Henry, Jessie Mueller) and opera (soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming), it also stars choreography by one of ballet's own heavy hitters: New York City Ballet soloist and resident choreographer Justin Peck, who shares top billing with the musical's director, Jack O'Brien.\nThere are more than a few familiar faces onstage, too.

Once dressed, McNeight was taken to a bank on Panama City Beach and was able to cash a 1,600 check. Although the agreement was for the transients to get about $80 for their part in the scam, McNeight took half of the money and fled on foot.\nDemarko Johnson and Johnathan Johnson were able to find McNeight at a gas station at Magnolia Beach Road and Thomas Drive. The two men entered the gas station after McNeight, one of them carrying a tire iron. Johnathon Johnson put McNeight in a choke hold, and they threatened McNeight with the tire iron, and took the money, his wallet, and his cell phone.\nThat was when McNeight called the BCSO to report the robbery. Although initially not forthcoming about the true circumstances surrounding the robbery, McNeight eventually told investigators how he got the money.\nJames Dean Riles, the other transient, was unable to cash his fraudulent check at the first bank, and was taken by Clarence Suggs and Reginald Hughes to a second bank where he was successful. He was paid $80 and was taken by the two men to Millville and left. Riles then called the Panama City Police Department to file a complaint about what he had done. Riles had important tag information on one of the vehicles.\nUsing the tag information, investigators were able to learn the two vehicles were rentals and eventually identified the four men from Atlanta.

This can be especially overwhelming when you have a larger IT department and a staff working on numerous projects at once. But the management of projects and ticket issues doesn't just fall on the heads of large companies. Even if you're a one-person shop consultancy, it can be easy to drown in a quagmire of projects.\nThankfully, there are a lot of tools available to help you with that. If you happen to be a fan of open source (and who isn't?), those tools are not only readily available, they are free and (generally speaking) easy to set up. I want to walk you through the installation of one such tool: Trac. Trac can be used as a wiki, a project management system, and for tracking bugs in software development. I'll be demonstrating the installation on a Ubuntu Server 16.04. And so, let's get to it.\nInstallation\nThe installation isn't terribly challenging, but does require a bit of typing. Log into your Ubuntu server and let's take care of the dependencies.\nIf your Ubuntu Server platform is without Apache, install it with the command:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 -y\nOnce that completes, install Trac with the command:\nsudo apt-get install trac libapache2-mod-wsgi -y\nNext, the auth_digest module must be enabled with the command:\nsudo a2enmod auth_digest\nNow we create the necessary document root for Trac (and give it the correct permissions) with the following commands:\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/trac sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/trac sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/trac\nFor our next trick, we create a Trac project directory (we'll call it test) with the command:\nsudo trac-admin /var/lib/trac/test initenv test sqlite:db/trac.db\nTime to give that new directory the proper permissions. This is done by issuing the following commands:\nsudo trac-admin /var/lib/trac/test deploy /var/www/html/trac/test sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/trac/test sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/trac/test\nFinally, we create both an admin user and a standard user with the commands:\nsudo htdigest -c /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest \"test\" admin sudo htdigest /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest \"test\" USER\nWhere USER is the name of the user you prefere.\nAfter both of the above commands, you'll be prompted to type (and confirm) a password. Remember these passwords.\nConfigure Apache\nCreate an Apache.conf file for Trac with the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/trac.conf\nAdd the following content to the new file:\nWSGIScriptAlias /trac/test /var/www/html/trac/test/cgi-bin/trac.wsgi AuthType Digest AuthName \"test\" AuthUserFile /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest Require valid-user\nSave and close that file.\nEnable our new site (and restart Apache) with the following commands:\nsudo a2ensite trac sudo systemctl restart apache2\nAccessing Trac\nOpen a web browser and point it to http://SERVER_IP/trac/test (where SERVER_IP is the IP address of your server). You will be prompted for login credentials. Log in with the user admin and the password you set when you created admin user earlier. You can also login with the non-admin user you created. There is actually no difference between the users (which could be a deal-breaker for some). One thing to note: If you need more users, you'll create them from the command line (in similar fashion as you did above). For every user you need to add to Trac, issue the command:\nsudo htdigest /var/lib/trac/test/.htdigest \"test\" USER\nWhere USER is the username. The above command will add the user to the project test. If you need to create more projects, you must go back through the process of creating a new project directory and then add users to it.\nOnce you've successfully authenticated, you'll be presented with the Trac web interface, were you can begin working (Figure A).\nFigure A\nYou can now go to Preferences and configure your installation of Trac. Once you've completed that, you can begin creating new tickets. If you get the (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) error, you can configure this with the command:\nsudo nano /var/lib/trac/test/conf/trac.ini\nIn that file, you'll see the section:\n[header_logo] alt = (please configure the [header_logo] section in trac.ini) height = -1 link = src = site/your_project_logo.png width = -1\nThat is where you'll configure a header logo to suit your company.\nSEE: IT project management: 10 ways to stay under budget (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nCongratulations\nYou now have your Trac system up and running. Although you might find systems with more features (and a more powerful configuration system), Trac is very simple to set up and use. If you're looking for a basic ticketing system that can serve as a project management tool, Trac just might fit the bill.\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

If that's the case, the only solution is in-house. For some, that means setting up a server and running a Git repository for the housing of proprietary or open source code. However, for some companies (especially those on the smaller side), having the resources (and time) to set up a server dedicated for Git storage may not be an option. That being the case, what do you do?\nFortunately there's a solution, one that's incredibly simple. Said solution is Gitstorage, an easy-to-deploy appliance dedicated to housing your Git repositories. Each appliance is a single board computer (based on the Raspberry Pi). The device is smaller than a credit card, has no moving parts, generates no heat, is wall-mountable, is powered by a standard USB (or included mini USB), and offers a standard ethernet connection. The full specs are:\nDimensions - 3.44\" \u00d7 2.93\" \u00d7 1.28\" (87.4 mm \u00d7 74.3 mm \u00d7 32.5 mm)\nWeight - 2.08 oz (59 g)\nWall mount - 4 screws\nAmbient temperature - 32 \u00b0F - 104 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C - 40 \u00b0C)\nMemory capacity - 16 GB (GS-16) 64 GB (GS-64)\nStorage for git repos - 10.6 GB (GS-16) 58.6 GB (GS-64)\nCertifications - CE, FCC\nProcessor - H2 quadcore Cortex-A7 with 512 MB RAM\nPower supply - Standard USB\nConnectors - 1 \u00d7 10/100 MBit/s Ethernet, USB-A, Power (USB Micro-B)\nWeb interface languages - English (US), French, German\nPrice (MSRP) - $399 USD (GS-16) $499 USD (GS-64)\nBut how well does the Gitstorage appliance work? Is it really that easy to deploy? Let's deploy one and find out.\nSEE: How to build a successful developer career (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nSetup\nThe setup of the Gitstorage is remarkably simple:\nUnpack the box. Plug the device into your network (you'll need a Cat5 cable). Connect the power cable. Wait 60 seconds.\nAt this point, things get a bit complicated. According to the directions, you should then be able to point a browser to http://gitst.net and the Gitstorage interface will appear. I tried that on both a Linux desktop and a MacBook Pro. Neither machine could find the device. In fact, if I attempted to ping the gitst.net address, I received a WAN IP address that didn't respond. The only way I was able to reach my Gitstorage device was to log into my router, look for gitstorage among the connected devices, and find out the IP address of the device. Once I had that IP address, I could point my browser to that address and login with user root and password password. At that point, the setup wizard is presented (Figure A).\nFigure A\nThe steps to the setup wizard are:\nLanguage selection\nEULA\nName the device\nDevice root CA creation or import (optional)\nEncryption password\nAdmin setup (email/password)\nDropbox setup (optional)\nEmail setup (optional)\nOnce I completed the wizard, trouble in paradise arose. During the first round, the final screen was blank. After a reboot, I had to walk through the wizard again. This time around the final screen appeared, the All set link didn't work. So I returned to the IP address and was presented with a login screen. I attempted to use the admin email/password I'd setup during the wizard, but that wouldn't work. I then attempted root/password... again to no avail. After another reboot (unplug, wait a few seconds, plug back in), I was (once again) sent to the setup wizard (only this time, half-way through). Once again, the final screen links wouldn't work.\nFortunately, I was sent two devices, so I unplugged the first (a GS-16) and plugged in the second (a GS-64). This time around, everything went smoothly and I was able to log into the Gitstorage interface (Figure B).\nFigure B\nUsage\nFrom the main interface, your first task is to create users. Click on the Users button and add the necessary information for a new user (Figure C).\nFigure C\nYou can now create a new repository. However, new repositories can only be created by the Root user. This is a problem. Why? Remember that admin user created during setup? I was unable to login with that user. So the only user with root privileges is root and the password is, well, not even remotely secure. Changing that password isn't nearly as intuitive as you might think (at least not from an admin perspective). Instead of the root user password change option being in the Settings sections, you must click on the Root user button in the upper right corner. From the popup menu (Figure D), click Account.\nFigure D\nIn the resulting window, click Password. When prompted, type (and verify) the new password for the root user. Log out and log back in with your new credentials. Now click on the Repositories entry in the left navigation, click the Create button, give the repository a name, and click Submit. Once you've created the repository, click on the Settings entry for it and then click the Add user button, so you can add users to the repository (otherwise the root user will be the only one with access).\nSEE: 10 Terminal commands to speed your work on the Mac (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nSmooth sailing\nAnd that's pretty much all there is to setting up a Gitstorage device. Although I did have one hiccup with the first appliance, setting up the second resulted in some pretty smooth sailing for using an in-house Git repository. If you're looking for an incredibly simple solution for code collaboration (and you don't have the resources to setup your own Git server), I highly recommend a Gitstorage device. It's a simple, small, and elegant solution that should serve you well.\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Cloud Insights Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

According to a new report from the research firm Gartner, the cloud is the fastest-growing segment of the IT industry, and it's growing at a faster rate than any other.\n\nThe report, titled \"The Cloud: The Next Big Thing in IT,\" says that the cloud is expected to grow from $1.5 trillion in revenue in 2015 to $2.5 trillion in 2020. That's a whopping $1.5 trillion in revenue in just five years.\n\nThe cloud is also expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall IT industry, which is expected to grow from $1.5 trillion in revenue", "gold_ref": "<|endoftext|> If you've ever wondered why so many companies are making moves toward the cloud, the answer may surprise you: It's fear of missing out. According to recent report from Commvault and CITO Research, 81% of business leaders are embracing the cloud because they're concerned about missing out on cloud advancements.\nSo, just how many executives are making that move? According to the report, 93% of respondents said that at least some of their processes were being moved to the cloud. Additionally, 56% said that they had already moved, or intended to move, all of their processes to the cloud.\n\"The survey unequivocally confirms that Cloud FOMO is real and on the mind of C-level and other IT leaders who are grappling with bringing the value of this new frontier to their organizations, from increasing IT outcomes to being a strategic driver for increased business agility,\" Dan Woods, CTO of CITO Research, said in the release. \"The research indicates the migration toward the cloud is underway in full force, even as companies struggle to understand cloud capabilities. Data protection and recovery was highlighted as a fundamental area where the cloud is having significant business impact.\"\nSEE: Special report: The cloud v. data center decision (free PDF)\nDon Foster, senior director of solutions marketing for Commvault, said in the report that cloud technologies are still seen as a key driver for digital transformation. As such, it makes sense that these business leaders would be concerned about getting to the cloud quickly.\nThe most important cloud projects cited by the respondents were data protection and backup, and data recovery, as noted by 75% of the respondents and 63% respectively.\nHowever, there are some challenges holding these companies back from realizing their cloudy dreams. The sheer volume of data was cited by 68% of those surveyed as a key barrier, while 65% pointed to a struggle with skills and talent, and 55% said policies were the biggest barrier.\nThese business leaders are putting their money on the line, too. Some 87% plan on putting more money in their budget for cloud investments.\nThe reasons for why these respondents wanted to move to the cloud were varied. Of those surveyed, 33% noted that \"customer focus through business agility\" was their primary reason for moving to the cloud.

Here are the big takeaways:\nIndividuals can get access to all of their data from a given firm, including their employer, by filing a subject access request.\nThe GDPR will eliminate the cost for subject access requests and shorten the required response time from 40 days to 30.\nThe May 25 deadline for the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is fast-approaching, and the coming changes will greatly shift the ability of companies to interact with customer data.\nMany people know the GDPR for its hard-line regulation around the \"right to be forgotten,\" where an individual can request a company to erase the personal data it holds on them. However, it also contains the right to access any information that may be held by a company, including your employer.\nThe process for data access under GDPR will be mostly the same as it was under the Data Protection Act of 1998, but with a few slight differences. For starters, a person will need to file a subject access request (SAR) that, as noted by the Guardian, is simply \"an email, fax or letter asking for their personal data.\"\nSEE: EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy (Tech Pro Research)\nFor clear guidelines on submitting an SAR, see the Subject access code of practice from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). There is no particular format required, as long as the request is made in writing.\nThere are two key differences between SAR requests made under the Data Privacy Act and those made under GDPR: The cost and time frame.\nBefore GDPR, the maximum fee that could be charged for access to your data was \u00a310, or about $14. Under GDPR, however, that fee is being removed for standard requests. Although, the ICO also notes that a firm may charge a \"reasonable fee\" when \"a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.\"\nAccording to SAR guidelines from the ICO, an individual should have the personal data held on them described, be told whether their personal data is being processes, be told why it's being processed, be told if that data is being sent anywhere else, and be given a copy the data and details of its sourcing.\nThe other detail that will change with personal data access under GDPR is how long companies have to respond to your request. Under the Data Privacy Act, companies had 40 calendar days to respond once they received a request. Now, however, they will have to provide the data within one month of receiving the request. The company can file for an extension of an extra two months if the \"requests are complex or numerous,\" according to the ICO's right of access page.\nIf the request is made electronically, the firm will provide the data in an accessible electronic format. However, the ICO's page notes that GDPR best practices recommend companies establish a secure self-service portal system for easy access.\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

However, a majority of companies likely missed the compliance deadline, and many employees remain unaware of the policies needed to keep data safe.\n\"Data privacy is a hot topic with GDPR going into effect,\" said Dave Rickard, technical director at CIPHER Security. \"An awful lot of companies may not think they have exposure to it, but there are lots of variables in that.\"\nFor example, one online retailer Rickard works with has many customers from the EU, but can't geolocate them from the website. Others don't work with EU citizens, but have data processing and storage facilities there, which are also subject to GDPR.\nSEE: EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy (Tech Pro Research)\nGDPR will likely influence data privacy policies in other countries, Rickard said. However, cultural differences, particularly between the EU and US, may make this difficult.\n\"In the EU people are very centered on the perspective that 'My name, my social security number, my passport information, everything that is PII about me, belongs to me. It's part of my individuality,'\" he said. \"Whereas in North America, people have long since taken the perspective instead that data is currency. There are so many business models that are built on it. Data is money.\"\nThe majority of companies that need to be compliant with GDPR are not yet, Rickard said. \"I'd say compliance right now is only at about 35% or 40% at the most,\" he said. \"I think a lot of people are taking a wait and see approach.\"\nSome of the bigger players like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are going to be the canaries in the coal mine, Rickard said. \"I think that they'll have actions taken on them first, and people are going to wait and see if the actual GDPR penalties play out the way that they've been published.\"\nCompanies that fail to comply with GDPR will face a penalty of either 4% of their global revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater.\nHere are five types of policies that companies must ensure they have in place and have trained employees on in the age of GDPR, according to Rickard.\n1. Encryption policies\nMost companies lack policies around data encryption, Rickard said. \"Most people who are data owners are unaware of whether their data is encrypted at rest or not,\" he added. \"GDPR is big on encryption at rest.\"\nSEE: Encryption policy (Tech Pro Research)\n2. Acceptable use policies\nAn acceptable use policy should covers things like what applications are allowed, what web searching and social media habits are appropriate for the business, and the potential threats to brand reputation, Rickard said.\n3. Password policies\nPasswords remain a common digital entry point into an organization for hackers. Even if, in the best case scenario, employees use complex passwords that are changed often and not shared, human error and carelessness can still put a business at risk. \"One of the easiest ways to breach a company is to put somebody on the janitorial staff and go looking at desks,\" Rickard said. \"People often have Post-it notes on monitors with passwords on them.\"\n4. Email policies\nIT should have an email policy in place that hardens systems and can detect spam and viruses, Rickard said. \"The kind of information that can be disclosed via email should be spelled out very clearly,\" he added.\n5. Data processing policies\nCompanies need to do data process flow mapping to see what data is being collected, how it's being processed, and who is receiving processed copies, Rickard said. \"GDPR closes all those gaps,\" he added.\nEmployee training is paramount for ensuring these policies are enforced, Rickard said. Raising awareness of the threat landscape and common vulnerabilities can help counteract human error.\n\"Security awareness and training is the cornerstone of any security program,\" he added.\nFor tips on how to best train employees on cybersecurity practices, click here.\nStay up to date on all the latest cybersecurity threats.

Go is cool, Swift is nifty, but old-school Java keeps reinventing itself to power both yesterday's and tomorrow's applications.\nDepending on how you count, some 14 million Java programmers code today, with many of them paid well to maintain massive enterprise applications (an estimated 80% of enterprise workloads run on Java). Redmonk, in its latest Q1 2018 survey, says Java is the second-most popular language after JavaScript among developers.\nNot that Java lacks challenges. For example, Java is perhaps the most divisive technology in the industry\u2014a morass of competing vendors with a constipated governance model that excludes much more than it includes. In this way, Java has left obvious gaps and frustration for developers who need a bridge to a cloud-native future.\nSEE: Job description: Java developer (Tech Pro Research)\nTo ease that frustration, Tuesday the Eclipse Foundation unveiled new directions for Java EE under the recently-named-by-community-vote Jakarta EE Working Group, the successor to Java EE (which remains licensed by Oracle and maintained under the JCP).\nJava, cloud-friendly? It just might happen.\nAn open Java\nThe one thing everyone agrees about Java is that it's imperfect. And yet there's hope. No longer your grandparent's Cobol, what if a vibrant community embraced Jakarta EE and pushed it much faster than any Java EE before? Under the Eclipse Foundation's guidance, we may finally get the power of open source collaboration to build on the best of Java's two decades of work. Through this new Jakarta EE Working Group process, we should see big Java EE vendors like IBM, Red Hat, and Oracle working within the open processes of the Eclipse Foundation with smaller vendors like Tomitribe and Payara.\nIn this world, there's no single vendor to impose its will on Java. Instead, we may finally get a true code meritocracy where Java communities and individuals function as peers. Instead of a divisive force, Jakarta EE could become a catalyst to join disparate Java communities behind a shared goal. In this case, my bet is on a race to some version of cloud-native implementation for Jakarata EE.\nYou can read all the details on the new Eclipse Foundation governance model online but for me, it's much more interesting to see where the community wants to go. To the credit of the Eclipse Foundation, they surveyed more than 1,800 Java developers worldwide to take the pulse of the Java community. Under Oracle's (or Sun's) control, this sort of community outreach simply didn't happen (though, to its credit, Oracle made the decision to move Java to the Eclipse Foundation's stewardship).\nJava's cloudy future\nIn the survey, the Eclipse Foundation learned that the three most critical areas that developers want Jakarta EE to prioritize are:\nBetter support for microservices (60%) Native integration with Kubernetes (57%) Faster pace of innovation (47%)\nSEE: How to build a successful developer career (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nAlmost half (45%) of the Java developers surveyed are already building microservices, with more (21%) planning to do so within the next 12 months. Add to this the fact that half of these developers currently only run a fifth of their Java applications in the cloud but 30% say they'll run 60% or more of their applications in the cloud, and it's clear how much pent-up demand there is for a more cloud-friendly Java. To get there, roughly a third of the developers surveyed have embraced Kubernetes. This is a cloud-savvy crowd that needs their preferred programming model to keep pace with their ambitions.\nNone of this was a surprise, of course. Java developers aren't living in a cloud-free world. Developers want a framework of tools that helps them be more successful using the Java skills they already have to build next-generation, cloud native applications. With the new Jakarta EE, they just might get their wish.\nClick here to subscribe to TechRepublic's Cloud Insights newsletter.

Tax time is not exempt, so to speak.\nWhether you work in finance or you support users who do, it's important to be on the lookout this tax season for phishing schemes geared towards obtaining confidential information from unsuspecting individuals.\nWhat should users look out for?\nA common phishing attempt involves compromised or spoofed emails which purport to be from an executive at your organization and are sent either to human resources or finance/payroll employees. The email requests a list of employees and their related W-2 forms.\nThat's not all, however. Another common scam (which can occur throughout the year) involves receiving a phone call from an individual claiming to be from the IRS (caller ID can be spoofed to show this as well) who informs you that you owe money for back taxes and often threatens law enforcement retribution if payment (usually via credit card over the phone) isn't provided.\nThe IRS will never call you on the phone to report you owe them money nor demand money over the phone; they utilize the postal service for such notifications. They also will not engage in threats and are supposed to provide an opportunity for you to work constructively with them or negotiate payment.\nSEE: IT leader's guide to cyberattack recovery (Tech Pro Research)\nWhat standard protection methods should be used?\nThe typical safeguards against phishing can protect you and your employees; establish a policy against requesting confidential information through email, call people directly to verify such requests, arrange for secure transfer of data, and limit the number of employees who possess the authority to access or handle W-2 forms.\nThe IRS also recommends contacting them about any malicious activity. Phishing attempts can be reported to phishing@irs.gov. If someone from your company has given out W-2 information, contact dataloss@irs.gov with a description of what happened and how many employees were affected. Also make sure not to attach any confidential information!\nIf your company is contacted by scammers claiming you owe the IRS money, report it via the IRS Impersonation Scam Reporting webpage. You can also call 800-366-4484. You should also report this to the Federal Trade Commission via the FTC Complaint Assistant on FTC.gov.\nWhat else is available to help here?\nEducation and establishing proper procedures can be helpful in minimizing risk, but I also highly recommend using technology to safeguard data as well. While both technology and humans may be prone to failure, technology is harder to fool or take advantage of.\nWith that in mind, data loss prevention (DLP) can be a handy tool in combating phishing gimmicks of this nature. DLP systems examine traffic coming in and out of an organization: emails, instant messages, web access - anything that is sent over the network. These systems can sniff out confidential information such as Social Security numbers and block them from being transmitted.\nThis comes with a potential cost, however; legitimate traffic may end up blocked, such as when employees email tax information to their tax preparers or their own personal accounts. This can pose a challenge for DLP systems (and those responsible for administering them) in separating the wheat from the chaff. The end result is undoubtedly a slew of false positives with frustrated and/or confused employees.\nSEE: Intrusion detection policy (Tech Pro Research)\nAnother potential solution is user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA). UEBA can determine the likelihood the employee is sending tax information to themselves via their personal email address by analyzing behavioral patterns to determine the legitimacy of specific activities.\nFor example, if an employee named Ray Donovan sends a W-2 form from his corporate email address (ray.donovan@company.com) to his Gmail address (ray.donovan72@gmail.com), UEBA can determine that it's highly likely this information is being sent to the same person and will not send a critical alert nor block the transmission. It helps if Ray has a history of sending himself emails of this nature so UEBA can mark that behavior as normal.\nHowever, in a genuine phishing scenario where Ray sends a W-2 form to SWRedLeader55@gmail.com, an email address he has not previously contacted, UEBA could determine that it's not the same person, analyze further using behavioral comparisons and send alerts or take action as necessary.\nWhat about a situation where an employee is emailing confidential information to themselves when they shouldn't (such as someone else's W-2 form, or their own despite company policies prohibiting this)? UEBA can still send alerts which can then result in investigational activity and appropriate discipline as needed, including termination. Making employees aware that this activity is analyzed and monitored can serve as a deterrent and ensure confidential information remains in appropriate hands.\nFor more security tips and news, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

However, the public's acceptance of smart locks has been less than stellar\u2014initial cost vs. actual benefits are seemingly the primary reason why.\nImage: Amazon\nThe low adoption of smart locks may soon change if the powers that be at Amazon have their way. The company recently introduced Amazon Key, a remotely-controlled building-access platform\u2014consisting of Amazon's Cloud Cam, a compatible smart lock, and smartphone app (shown to the right)\u2014that allows Amazon-approved delivery personnel to open locked doors and leave deliveries inside the customer's home or office. A slew of additional conveniences not related to package delivery may also help the acceptance of smart locks.\nThat said, the public's interest in smart locks will only improve if the benefits outweigh the costs, and the technology is proven to be physically safe and electronically secure.\nSecurity issues have already been reported about Amazon Key. Liam Tung in his ZDNet article Amazon: We're fixing a flaw that leaves Key security camera open to Wi-Fi jamming writes, \"A malicious courier could easily freeze the Key's Cloud Cam and roam a customer's house unmonitored.\"\nConcerns about smart locks and security were raised way back in 2013. My TechRepublic article High-tech home security products: Who are they really helping? quotes several experts who question the security of smart locks and the technology supporting them.\nSEE: Internet of Things Policy (Tech Pro Research)\nAV-TEST put six smart locks' data security through their paces\nKnowing what experts were saying about smart-lock systems four years ago and the likelihood of smart locks becoming popular, the people at AV-TEST, an independent IT-security testing lab, decided to see if things have improved. The lab's engineers developed a test program and put these six smart locks through their paces:\nAugust Smart Lock (USA)\nBurg-Wachter secuENTRY easy 501 (Germany)\nDanalock V3 (Denmark)\neQ-3 Equiva Bluetooth Smart Lock (Germany)\nNoke Padlock (USA)\nNuki Combo (Austria)\nTest environments\nData security was the first thing considered by the engineers with special emphasis on acquisition, storage, and transmission of data; the following image depicts how they employed Wireshark to capture traffic between the smart lock being tested and the controlling smartphone application. Besides communications, the team examined each system's hardware and software, tested the software-update process, and determined whether the associated smart-lock application had any security issues.\nImage: AV-TEST\nThe results\nIt seems smart locks have improved considerably in the past four-plus years. From the AV-TEST report: \"Convenience does not have to mean less security. This reassuring conclusion can be made following the surprisingly strong results of the smart-lock testing.\" Concerning the test results, the test engineers offer the following insights.\nInstallation: Despite physical differences, all smart locks evaluated by AV-TEST installed easily\u2014systems manufactured by eQ-3 and Nuki being the easiest.\nLocal communications: All tested smart locks are locally activated via Bluetooth. \"As a standard feature, the smart locks use encryption, mostly AES with at least 128 bits,\" mentions the report. \"Three locks, August, Danalock, and Nuki can encrypt at a higher rate\u2014AES with 256 bits.\"\nThe AV-TEST engineers report that smart locks by August, Danalock, and Nuki can integrate with local Wi-Fi networks; this allows location-independent remote control using the mobile device's smart-lock app. According to the report, neither Bluetooth nor SSL-encrypted Wi-Fi connections introduce any detectable vulnerabilities.\nData protection: AV-TEST's engineers measured each smart lock's privacy policy against European data-protection law. One concern centered on whether systems save more data than what is needed to operate properly. From the report: \"For August, Danalock, and Noke, the testers see a need for improvement, e.g., in terms of information on stored data and its use by third parties. An adaptation to European data-protection law would easily remedy these defects.\"\nSEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (free PDF) (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\nSmartphone-app security: The report warns that apps are a potential target for attackers, in particular how each app manages access permissions and log files. All smart-lock systems but August and Danalock handled access and log files adequately. The engineers are concerned that August and Danalock generate comprehensive debug logs that provide clues to how the app functions. Additionally, August keeps debug logs in a protected area, whereas Danalock does not, making it possible to read the log files using tools like Android Logcat. The report suggests both August and Danalock need to improve security in this area.\nOne serious misstep: The AV-TEST paper took issue with the smart lock from Burg-Wachter because the lock system does not require the user to change the default admin password. \"A dangerous complacency, as IoT devices with unchanged default login details are easy prey for attackers,\" mentions the report.\nOverall results\nEach smart lock was rated on local communications, external communications, app security, and data protection, with three stars holding top honors. The following graph shows the overall results.\nImage: AV-TEST\nOn a positive note, the AT-TEST report notes, \"All in all, it appears the manufacturers of smart door locks, unlike many other manufacturers of smart home products, did their homework.\"\nThe report concludes by saying, \"The AV-TEST Institute rated five out of six of the locking systems evaluated in the quick test as having solid basic security with theoretical vulnerabilities at the most.\"\nStay informed about IT security news, tips, and tutorials\u2014subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

What's the reality of this new wireless standard?\nVyas: The reality is that it does promise us to transform. You very rightly use the word digital, but my translation of digital is it promises to change the way people would live, work, and play going forward in a more significant fashion than what you saw with the previous generations.\nIf I could just expand on that a bit, 5G is not just about the throughput and the speed and the power and the latencies, but 5G is about exciting, exciting propositions that will come our way both in the enterprise space and in the consumer domain. Given that 5G also combined with some of the other later technological innovations that are happening as we speak, for example, artificial intelligence, will just enable a certain set of use cases. It will just change the paradigm of how people communicate, how people consume experiences, or how people transact business. All of that is going to change, so I guess that's the reason why everybody is so hyped up, if I may, about 5G.\nPatterson: So, how? We know that the capabilities of 2G, 3G, and 4G has iterated and created new technological capabilities. What specifically about 5G enables IoT, enables high-speed mobile devices, and enables artificial intelligence?\nVyas: Yes. I think it is, and all of them are related, the convergence of other software technologies that are advancing at the speed of light right now. Let's take two of them, just to build a use case, right? Let's take VR, virtual reality. Let's take IoT, which is the ability to connect the devices and harness the power of data, right? Now, combine that with the wireless advancements that will happen with the 5G technology from an access, as well as from how the data is processed. It will create use cases that have hereto not been possible.\nSEE: Virtual and augmented reality policy (Tech Pro Research)\nOne of my favorite examples that I often give is think of an NFL game, and think of the tailgate parties that happen outside any stadium. There are any number of thousands of people who are perennial tailgate party goers. They don't even enter the stadium game after game, year after year, but they like to spend a lot of money outside the stadium.\nThe experience that they will now get, imagine with the VR and with the discoverable aspect of the network that 5G does, where if you, Dan, for example, as a big fan of a certain running back of a certain NFL team, as you're partying with your buddies outside a certain stadium, you will be notified that something dramatic happened inside the stadium and with whatever device that is available at the time, which is also by the way advancing, with 5G and with the fact that you are discoverable by the network and the latencies and the availability of the network is like never before, the throughout is like never before, so the IoT on a camera or a device, the VR experience, powered by 5G, you will there and then and you will be the only person who will be able to stand almost right next to the running back and experience as the things explode and happen at the site.\nJust the sheer power of that use case is phenomenal, and the money that different people in the ecosystem will make out of it, including the telecom service provider, I think can be quite an interesting paradigm in my view.\nPatterson: What are some of the challenges or roadblocks to the rollout of 5G?\nVyas: I think there are plenty. One of the biggest ones is going to be, without even getting into the technology aspect at this point, I would say is still a major part of the industry will still struggle to find the justification to invest in the capital, from a business case ROI standpoint.\nNow, on that one, one is also hearing as I go around the world and meet different CTOs and other executives of service providers, one is hearing that there are different ways of skinning that cat, if I may. The overall cost of 5G deployment is likely to be atmospherically high at this point, there are all indicators that the likely cost is going to be cheaper than what was in 4G, and if that happens, that itself is probably a business case-justification.\nSEE: IT pro's guide to the evolution and impact of 5G technology (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nOf course, there is a bigger underlying assumption that the prices in the marketplace at least hold up, and if they drop, they drop only marginally and not dramatically. There's no guarantee of that, but at least that's a possibility. That's one challenge, clearly that the market is going to face.\nThe second is going to be a more technical and execution challenge, which is the availability of the technology, the trials that need to go through in a very satisfactory fashion worldwide so that people get enough confidence to go and deploy the technology at a very large scale, which I don't think is a question of if, it is more a question of when. I guess the challenge would be more for delay rather than really making it happen.\nPatterson: Manish, I think that that is a great point. I wonder if you could leave us with say, the next 18- to 36-months in the rollout of 5G. Where are we in a year, year and a half, and where are we in three or four years?\nVyas: I would say in three to four years time, I would be surprised if the world is not entirely enabled by 5G. When I say that with a sense of responsibility that there would be still be a certain set of companies that may not adopt it, because of how they would want to position it, which would be challenging, and they would be under tremendous pressure, but I believe that in the next three to four years, as the other technologies also evolve, the other software technologies, I believe in the next three to four years, we will see a very large scale deployment worldwide.\nIn the imminent short-term, the 18, 20 months, I think we will see the early adopters clearly making progress. This year alone, we might see some of the major tier-one service providers in the North American continent, we will see them doing about 12 to 15 trials. By that, I mean 12 to 15 locations or cities would be 5G-enabled by the end of the year.\nFor more about the latest tech innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

Python\nCurrently enjoying a surge in usage, Python is regularly used by web and desktop developers, sysadmin/devops, and more recently by data scientists and machine-learning engineers.\nThe IOActive paper found that Python contains undocumented methods and local environment variables that can be used to execute operating-system commands.\nBoth Python's mimetools and pydoc libraries have undocumented methods that can be exploited in this way, which IOActive used to run Linux's id command.\n2. Perl\nPopular for web server scripting, sysadmin jobs, network programming and automating various tasks, Perl has been in use since the late 1980s.\nIOActive highlights the fact that Perl contains a function that will attempt to execute one of the arguments passed to it as Perl code. It describes the practice as a \"hidden feature\" within a default Perl function for handling typemaps.\n3. NodeJS\nNodeJS provides a server-side environment for executing JavaScript, the language commonly used for scripting in web browsers.\nIOActive found that NodeJS' built-in error messages for its require function could be exploited to determine whether a file name existed on the machine and to leak the first line of files on a system\u2014potentially useful information for an attacker.\n4. JRuby\nThe Java implementation of the Ruby programming language was found to allow remote code execution in a way that isn't possible in Ruby as a base language.\nBy calling executable Ruby code using a specific function in JRuby, IOActive was able to get the function to execute an operating system command, the Linux command id, by loading a file on a remote server.\n5. PHP\nThe venerable server scripting language was used to call an operating system command, again the Linux command id, using the shell_exec() function and exploiting the way PHP handles the names of constants.\n\"Depending on how the PHP application has been developed, this may lead to remote command execution,\" say researchers.\nThat said, many web admins have long known the potential risk posed by PHP's shell_exec() function, and how to disable it.\nExploitable flaws in each programming language were identified using a tool called a differential fuzzer, which was designed to automatically find vulnerabilities. The fuzzer works by running through a large array of scenarios in each language, calling each of the languages' native functions with a wide variety of different arguments and observing the results.\nKeep up to date on all of the newest tech trends.

What the heck is a decentralized media economy? Well, surprise, surprise, it runs on the blockchain.... You have worked at The Washington Post, as well as RebelMouse and other media companies. First, why a startup? Why a blockchain startup? And, why Po.et?\nDicker: Three of the most frequent questions I get. So why a startup? I think my past three years at The Washington Post have been somewhat startup in a legacy media news organization, and the fact that we were run by Jeff Bezos, who owns the Post. It was an amazing time for news, right, and all news media.\nThere was a lot of momentum and excitement behind all the work that we were doing. Especially when we took it to the tech side. And one thing that I've always focused on throughout my career was how do we build a better model for the business of media, which is what I found extremely hard to do. It's also extremely hard to do within just one media company.\nSo over the past few years, I've been building something at The Washington Post called RED, Research Experimentation Development, where we were building new technologies and systems to use on the Post, off the Post, licensed white label to really help build a better media economy. Then I started really understanding not just the technologies behind blockchain, but the philosophies behind them.\nThe idea of consensus and decentralization. Coincidentally, Po.et approached me in terms of going there, becoming the chief executive officer, and building the team. We could get into how that all went down, but that's how I ended up here now.\nPatterson: So the blockchain, this is possibly one of the most hyped technologies in recent memory. But it really is useful when you have to stamp a piece of asset, whatever that asset is. No matter whether it's gold and diamonds, or housing and real estate, or in this case, content. So a lot of us in media on the backend, we have content management systems and you can see a log of activity that is not necessarily for the public, but you can see what happens to a particular asset over time.\nWhy is a blockchain good for public pieces of media? And when I say assets, in this case we're referring to a post, or a video, or an audio podcast. Why is the blockchain so good at documenting those types of assets?\nDicker: Yeah, I think for one, a quick answer is the idea of immutability, right. The idea that something could be permanent and stored there. Mainly for attribution, being able to check to see who the owner of an idea is, whose authorship of a certain idea, and just make sure that that cannot be manipulated. I think that that's extremely important, but scary for a lot of media companies.\nI've had a couple conversations where folks in media have said, \"Well, that's terrifying because what if I need to redact a statement?\" Right, or what if I need to take something down for advertisements? And where I think we'll see the value of blockchain in media is also like philosophically how we change the way that we think and build content and creative ideas in the media landscape. What I mean by that is right now, we are used to a web, where we can delete, where we can change, and where we can alter.\nAnd what's really happened there is that people throw ideas out there, knowing that if they are wrong, they could change or delete, or things are not immutable, right, per se, which is what's happening on the blockchain. What I really hope beyond just the products of what it can do, is really that it'll change the way that we do things, right. Like in society today, there are consequences for things that you do. You can't just press the delete button or change, right. So you think about these sort of things before you actually act on them.\nAnd I think what we've seen in the media landscape is that people are very quick to send ideas or shoot ideas out there, knowing that they can hide behind something, or knowing that they could change something. And what does it really mean when you need to kind of account for those ideas, and when they are living on a blockchain forever? So one of which, when it comes to media on the blockchain, I think is this idea of security, immutability.\nSEE: What is blockchain? Understanding the technology and the revolution (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nThis new notion that you are now in control of your ideas and of your assets, both in a public and private, public key, private key manner. And being able to take control of that, right. We at Po.et, really want to focus more on the long tail creators, like we are accessible for everyone. We aim to be a library of the world's creative assets on the blockchain and are building different ways for access and people to do so. Whether that's through, as you mentioned, a content management system, or going directly to Po.et, or within your own domains.\nBut once you do that, what can you actually do on the domain? And I think there's two major things. One is really being able to own and manage your ideas. So how do you issue a content license? What should that cost? How can you make sure that your ideas are being heard and transacted on? An example that I give often and we see it every single day on Twitter, is that if you put something up on Twitter, which is a piece of media that can go viral beyond just the at replies, there's also Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed, and others saying, \"Hey, Dan. I love this. Do you mind if I use this?\"\nAnd at that moment, you really have already put it on Twitter and you just assume, \"Sure, right. It's already out there.\" Well, what if you had the opportunity to say, \"Oh, there's clearly value in this content I'm creating. Sure, here's my private key with the smart contract and rules that you need to abide by if you want to license and leverage this content.\"\nSo that is one thing that I think is extremely important that we'll learn both in terms of changing a behavior about applications of using blockchain for media. The other is this idea of transparency, as you mentioned, and reputation, right. In everything that we do in life, reputation matters. Like if you go to a hotel, you're going to look at the ratings. If you ride in an Uber, you look at ratings. Every single thing is based on that transparency and reputation. Even if you're going to eat something, right.\nTruth could be subjective, information could be subjective. Like the same way that you would look at maybe the back of a carton of milk and say, \"Okay, there's a lot of fat, but I'm cool with it.\" Or, you may say, \"No, like I don't want all that fat.\" But when it comes to information and transparency, that doesn't really exist. So I think this idea of building reputation for creators, not just to say, \"That this creator tells the truth and this creator doesn't tell the truth.\" But just give transparency as to the way that they navigate it-\nPatterson: Yeah, ownership and the attribution-\nDicker: Exactly.\nPatterson: Yeah.\nDicker: Exactly, and be able to see, has it been fact checked? Right, who has seen it? Has this person published before? They've taken this picture in Sri Lanka, are they actually in Sri Lanka? Right, or are they in New Jersey? So I think that sort of information really is applicable, especially nowadays, when it comes to deep fakes and people putting information out there, to really just get more exposure and transparency to the end consumer, so that they can make decisions on their own based on what they're consuming.\nPatterson: Yeah, so the obvious use cases could be say, iStock photo and allowing creators to control the assets that are there. But also social media, as well as news content, or almost any piece of content where an exchange of trust has to happen. And really what you're talking about with transparency, is the exchange of trust equity. And being able to say, \"This is the process by which a particular asset exists in an ecosystem, and you can vet and verify it using the blockchain.\" So you use the Ethereum blockchain.\nDicker: We use the ERC-20.\nPatterson: Yeah, so explain to me how that applies to Po.et, not just in terms of content, but you are building a content library. Why did you elect to use Ethereum? What are some of the advantages of that? And, is this the next emerging hot blockchain?\nDicker: So I want to back up and just make it clear. We stamp on the Bitcoin blockchain because it's the most secure blockchain. We leverage Ethereum for ERC-20 tokens because Po.et is a token dynamic-type model. In that, to build reputation, we need to build incentive systems, and that's why the Po.et token exists to help fuel and challenge the marketplace in order to get the best content up and the worst content down.\nI think with Ethereum, the most interesting thing that's happening is that they are opening up with these ERC-20 tokens and beyond, the opportunity for people to build their technologies on top of it. And that's where you've kind of seen a huge movement towards that blockchain and the opportunities of that blockchain. There's also companies like ConsenSys out in Bushwick, that are building right on top of this, companies for every single pocket of the industry that could leverage blockchain for proof, right, of value and really what it could really become.\nThat is definitely happening to answer your question. Like that trend is moving and there's a lot of accessibility there. Now that being said, we're way off, right, from building scalable blockchain solutions when it comes to enterprise and conversations that we would have had three years ago when I was at The Washington Post in talking about technologies built there. So that is somewhat exciting because I don't believe that we are dead set on one blockchain for anything.\nSEE: Blockchain: An insider's guide (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nPo.et's ambitions and the partnerships that we have and others that are building on top of the work that we're doing, are kind of opening up the same opportunity. Look, Po.et is build a protocol that is helping build reputation on the web. And if you want to help leverage that, to help build reputation within your applications, then you should build on Po.et. There's a company called Encrypt that's building on top of Po.et, which is really looking to circumvent censorship when it comes to information delivery.\nSo if you are posting an article or have a website, and you are concerned that your IP could be blocked, how can you leverage Encrypt to make sure that that information is then spread out in a bunch of different devices and not just one central server? To then be able to come back and have that information delivered, and that's something that's being built on top of Po.et. There's other conversations of people in media that are looking for certain solutions that want to build on top of what we're doing, as well.\nSo we leverage Bitcoin blockchain just because it's an easy marketing example to say, \"Look. If you value your money and you trust Bitcoin blockchain because money is the most important thing to you at this moment, well, your ideas are equally important, right? And if your ideas are important, you want them to be as secure as your money.\" But there are opportunities for us to port to either. There's opportunities for us to mimic or build our own.\nI think it's still early days, but the biggest thing that we're looking to do now is influence a space that could benefit from new thinking, right, the business of media really trying to figure out how to strengthen media companies, how to allow them to evolve, how can get we give power back to creators, right?\nHow do we give velocity to independent thought and a platform, where people could drive revenue and earn what they should earn, based off their ideas? An analogy... Or, sorry. I hate sports analogies, but an analogy-\nPatterson: I love sports analogies-\nDicker: And hopefully, the audience does, as well. But the way that free agency works in sports, right, does not really exist when it comes to media or content. So each writer is somewhat valued the same. I mean, we look at certain nuances like Twitter followers, or tenure, right, or work that they've completed.\nBut in sports, you have this opportunity where every single quarterback is rated, right, in front of the public based on their skillset, based on their salaries, based on all these different set of criteria.\nIn media, that really doesn't exist, right. So what if we can build these sort of valuations and services to set up, so that we can actually pinpoint the value of content and the value of media that everyone is creating, which personally, I believe is extremely undervalued right now.\nAnd I'm sure you agree, as well, and anyone who works in this space constantly is telling people that, \"Content cost money. Content is valuable. It costs a lot to create great content. If you want good content, you need to pay for it.\"\nBut I think what we need to do is start proving these things, and in order to prove these things, we need to set up dynamics and platforms in order to do so, and that's kind of what we're doing here.\nFor more on blockchain and other world-changing technology, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

Sort out the Control Panel / Settings app confusion\nWindows 10 adopts a rather confused approach to managing settings\u2014splitting the options between the legacy Control Panel and the Settings app.\nMicrosoft appears to be in the process of gradually migrating these options to the new Settings app, with each big feature update further diminishing the role of the Control Panel.\nHowever, having to juggle between the two menus is not particularly user friendly, and the changes in where settings lie is particularly aggravating for some users, as can be seen by the large number of forum posts this issue generates.\nYou can use the Search function to locate the Settings you need, but there are still clearly a large number of users who still struggle to locate what they're looking for.\n2. Give all users control over updates\nAll Windows 10 users should be given control over when updates are applied.\nCurrently there is no simple option for Windows 10 Home users to defer updates in the same way there is for users of Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions.\nSEE: Windows 10: Streamline your work with these power tips (free TechRepublic PDF)\nUsers of non-Home editions can toggle options in menus to put off updates for months at the very least. However, Home users have to engage in hacky workarounds, such as setting their connection to 'Metered', which can have unwanted side effects due to Windows no longer downloading most Windows updates or Windows Store app updates.\nMicrosoft should just relent and give the Home edition the same level of control over updates as is available to Pro users.\n3. Allow users to opt out of feature updates altogether\nNot everyone appreciates Microsoft's twice-yearly feature updates messing with their desktop, and, for some, the smattering of new features are, at best, unnecessary.\nMicrosoft should give all users the option to completely opt out of feature updates\u2014the most recent being the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update\u2014 and instead only receive essential patches and fixes.\nAs it is, users of Pro and Enterprise can defer feature updates for more than a year, so why not go one step further and let everyone opt out altogether.\nDoes it really make sense for people who don't have the slightest interest in virtual reality to suddenly find their computer has a Mixed Reality Portal?\nThere's even already precedent for the change, with Microsoft recently revealing that PCs with unsupported Intel Atom CPUs would not receive any feature updates post last summer's Anniversary Update.\n4. Stop trying to force Bing and the Edge browser on users\nWhile makes sense for Microsoft to build an ecosystem of linked services, from both a practical and commercial point of view, it would be nice if Microsoft let users choose their sniearch engine when using Windows built-in search feature.\nMicrosoft says that locking the Search function to Bing and its Edge browser is necessary to ensure the best possible experience for Windows 10 users.\nBut given the relatively limited market share of Bing and Edge, it's clear that many users prefer competing products and services, so again it would be good if Microsoft would allow users to use their search engine or browser of choice.\n5. Stop pushing the Microsoft Store so hard until it's better stocked\nMicrosoft is determined to get more people to use the Microsoft Store, whether by locking Windows 10 S to using Store apps, or by releasing Store exclusives.\nHowever, despite launching in 2012, the Store's selection of apps is still fairly lacklustre, especially compared to the unfettered selection of software available for the Window desktop.\nMicrosoft faces a classic chicken and egg problem: without the userbase, it won't get the apps, but without the apps, you can't attract the userbase.\nTrying to forcibly create an audience by creating an OS locked to the store isn't the answer, however, all it does is highlight just how sparse the offerings in the Microsoft Store are.\nBe your company's Microsoft insider with the help of these Windows and Office tutorials and our experts' analyses of Microsoft's enterprise products.

The view will change to the App Switcher you know and love (Figure A).\nFigure A\n2. How to force quit apps on the iPhone X\nInside of the App Switcher, you may be wondering how to force quit an app, because in this new switcher, swiping up does not quit the app. To force quit an app, launch the App Switcher, then tap and hold on an app. This will enter editing mode where you can either choose the \"-\" button that appears in the corner of each open app, or swipe up as you would on a non-iPhone X iOS device.\nAs we've mentioned in a previous article, you only need to Force Quit unresponsive apps. There is no need to force quit apps on a regular basis.\n3. How to quickly swipe to the previously used app on the iPhone X\nThe Home Indicator at the bottom of the screen gives you many capabilities at a single tap or swipe. Swiping from left to right on the Home Indicator will launch the previously used app from the App Switcher without the need to open the App Switcher. This feature is very useful on the iPhone and greatly improves multitasking capabilities because it lets you jump between apps quickly and efficiently.\nSEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n4. How to enable Reachability on the iPhone X\nReachability is an accessibility feature that can be enabled on previous iPhone models by double-tapping on the Home Button to slide the top of the screen down by half the screen to make top items more reachable while holding the device with one hand. With the Home Button gone, this feature has changed slightly and is not enabled by default.\nTo enable Reachability in iOS 11.1.1, follow these steps.\nOpen the Settings app. Navigate to General | Accessibility. Enable the option for Reachability (Figure B).\nFigure B\nTo use Reachability once it's enabled, swipe down on the Home Indicator at the bottom of the screen. You'll see the current app slide half way down the screen, giving you easier access to reach the items at the top of the screen.\n5. How to manage the iPhone X's Home Screen\nOn an iPhone X, you may be wondering how to exit out of Home Screen arranging mode (aka jiggly mode). First, enter this mode by tapping and holding on an icon or folder on the Home Screen. The icons will begin wiggling, and you can rearrange them. To exit this mode, swipe up from the bottom like you would to exit to the Home Screen from an app. In iOS 11.1.1, a Done button appears in the top right corner of the screen in the status bar area\u2014Tapping this button will also exit editing mode.\nFor more iPhone tips and tricks, subscribe to our Apple Weekly newsletter.

What are alternatives to FileVault 2? The main competitors are VeraCrypt, BitLocker, GnuPG, LibreCrypt, and EncFS.\nThe main competitors are VeraCrypt, BitLocker, GnuPG, LibreCrypt, and EncFS. How can I get FileVault 2? FileVault 2 is baked in to all versions of macOS and supported versions of OS X. The encryption program is turned off by default, though it's easy to enable.\nAdditional resources\nWhat is FileVault 2, and how does it encrypt the startup disk on Macs?\nFileVault 2 is an encryption program created by Apple that provides full-disk encryption of the startup disk on a Mac computer. By utilizing the latest encryption algorithms and leveraging the power and efficiency of modern CPUs, the entire contents of the startup disk are encrypted, preventing all unauthorized access to the data stored on the disk; the only people that can access the data have the account credentials that enabled FileVault on the disk, or possess the master recovery key.\nBy enabling FileVault 2's whole-disk encryption, data is secured from prying eyes and all attempts to access this data (physically or over the network) will be met with prompts to authenticate or error messages stating the data cannot be accessed\u2014even when attempting to access data backups, which FileVault 2 encrypts as well.\nAdditional resources\nWhy does FileVault 2 matter?\nFileVault 2, in and of itself, cannot prevent users from attacking your system or otherwise exfiltrating the encrypted data. The encryption program is not a substitute for proper physical, logical, and data security standards, but rather a part of the overall puzzle that makes up your device's security.\nData encryption is often seen as the last resort because, if all other security features in place are compromised, encrypted data will still be unreadable by everyone except people that have the decryption key, or those that can brute-force their way past the algorithm, which is easier said than done.\nSEE: All of TechRepublic's cheat sheets and smart person's guides\nIf the encryption standard in place is properly implemented and uses a strong, modern algorithm, and the recovery keys are not accessible or consist of a long, random key space, the attackers will have their work cut out for them. If the attackers gain access to the data sitting on the disk, they may be able to copy it, take it off your network, and even attack it directly, but they'll still be at an impasse if they cannot crack the encryption. And if the attackers cannot crack the encryption, your data will remain unreadable, and subsequently, of little to no real use or value.\nAdditional resources\nIs FileVault 2 available to all macOS users?\nUsers running OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later, all the way through the current version of macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), may enable and fully utilize the full-disk encryption capabilities of FileVault 2 on their desktop or laptop Mac computers.\nBy default, the feature is disabled; however, it only takes accessing the System Preferences and clicking the Turn On FileVault 2 button to enable the feature and encrypt your whole disk. Encryption may be enabled by the user or managed by the administrators for company-owned devices. Administrators have set policies via Profile Manager and/or scripts that will enable FileVault 2 during deployment and implement institutional recovery keys that the company manages in order to recover encrypted data per device, if needed.\nSEE: Essential reading for IT leaders: 10 books on cybersecurity (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\nOnce FileVault 2 is enabled, only the user with administrative privileges that enabled FileVault 2 with their account may decrypt the drive's contents. Additionally, a master recovery key is created during the initial process; users with either of those keys may be the only ones to decrypt the volume and read the contents of the drive.\nAdditional resources\nWhat are the pros and cons to using FileVault 2?\nThe pros to using FileVault 2\nIt's a native Apple solution that is designed by Apple for Apple computers.\nFileVault 2 supports legacy hardware, even for devices that are no longer officially supported by Apple.\nDeployment of FileVault 2 may be locally or centrally managed by users or the IT department.\nWhole-disk encryption works to safeguard all data stored on disk now and in the future.\nBackup of encrypted data works seamlessly with Time Machine to create automated backup sets.\nDisks encrypted with FileVault 2 must first be unlocked by user accounts that are \"unlocked enabled\"; these are typically accounts with administrative privilege, preventing non-admin accounts from accessing the disk's contents, regardless of the ACL permissions configured.\nFileVault 2 uses a strong form of block-cipher chain mode, XTS, based off the AES algorithm using 128-bit blocks and a 256-bit key.\nThe cons to using FileVault 2\nLegacy FileVault (or FileVault 1) does not encrypt the whole-disk\u2014only the contents of a user's home folder. This affects legacy hardware that do not support the features in FileVault 2.\nBacking up encrypted data with Time Machine can only be done when a user is logged off of the session. For on-the-fly backups, the destination path must be a Time Machine Server, which requires macOS Server to perform online backups.\nThe encryption passphrase used to encrypt the disk is the same as the end-user's password that enabled FileVault 2. If the password becomes compromised, the disk may be encrypted and data may be compromised.\nEnabling FileVault 2 can have a negative impact on I/O performance of approximately 20-30% of modern CPUs, and it noticeably worsens performance on older processor hardware.\nIf the passphrase or recovery key must be changed, the entire volume will need to be decrypted and have the encryption process run again with the new key.\nAny device with FileVault 2 enabled must be unlocked by an admin credentialed account prior to being accessed or used by a non-admin account. If the device is not unlocked, non-admin accounts will not be able to use the computer until it is first successfully unlocked.\nIndividual files, folders, or any other kind of data cannot be encrypted on the fly. Only data that resides on the local disk or FileVault 2-encrypted volumes may be encrypted in their entirety.\nAdditional resources\nWhat are some of the alternatives to FileVault 2?\nVeraCrypt is a free, open source disk encryption software that provides cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It was derived from TrueCrypt, which was a full-disk encryption application that discontinued support by its creators after a security audit revealed several vulnerabilities in the software.\nHaving acquired the use of TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt forked the former app and corrected the vulnerabilities, while adding some changes to strengthen the way in which the files are stored. VeraCrypt creates a virtually encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a disk that can be read by the OS. It can encrypt the entire disk, a partition, or storage devices, such as USB flash drives and provides real-time on the fly encryption, which can be hardware-accelerated for better performance. It also supports TrueCrypt's hidden volume and hidden operating system features.\nBitLocker is Microsoft's full-disk encryption featured in supported versions of Windows Vista and later. Using default settings, BitLocker uses AES encryption with XTS mode in conjunction with 128-bit or 256-bit keys for maximum protection, especially when leveraged with a TPM module to ensure integrity of the trusted boot path, which prevents many physical attacks and boot sector malware from compromising your data.\nWhen used on a computer in an Active Directory environment, BitLocker supports key escrow, which allows the Active Directory account to store a copy of the recovery key. In the event that data needs to be recovered, administrators may retrieve the key.\nGnuPG is based on the PGP encryption program created by Phil Zimmermann, and later bought by Symantec. Unlike Symantec's offering, GnuPG is completely free software and part of the GNU Project. The software is command-line based and offers hybrid encryption by use of symmetric-key cryptography for performance, and public-key cryptography for the ease of exchanging secure keys.\nWhile the lack of GUI may not be for everyone, the program's flexibility allows for signed communications, file encryption, and, with some configuration, disk encryption to protect data. Dubbed the universal crypto engine, GnuPG can run directly from the CLI, shell scripts, or from other programs, often serving as a backend for other applications.\nLibreCrypt is a transparent full-disk encryption program that fully supports Windows and contains partial support for Linux distributions. It is open source and has an online community of users that are committed to resolving issues and introducing new features. Often cited as the most easy to use encryption program for Windows, it can create encrypted containers as well, mounting them as removable disks in Windows Explorer for easy access.\nIt addition to the multitude of supported encryption and hashing standards and modes, it also supports smart cards and security tokens to authenticate users, and decrypts data at the file level, partition, or for the entire disk.\nEncFS is an encrypted filesystem that runs in the user-space, using the FUSE library. The FUSE library acts as an interface for filesystems in user-space that allows users to mount and use filesystems not natively supported by the host OS. FUSE/EncFS are open source releases and support Linux, BSD, Windows, Android devices, and macOS. It is also available in a number of languages, as it has been translated by community members.\nWith active community support on GitHub and regular updates, EncFS offers users the ability to create a filesystem that can be mounted and used to store secure data files, and then it may be unmounted to protect against offline attacks and unauthorized user access.\nAdditional resources\nHow can I get FileVault 2?\nFileVault 2 is in all versions of OS X from 10.7 through macOS 10.13\u2014it just needs to be enabled, as the service is turned off by default to allow end users to perform the initial setup process, which allows them to create a master recovery key. This key will act as a backup in the event that they become locked out of their account and must recover data via an alternate path.\nUsers of OS X prior to 10.7 may use Legacy FileVault, or FileVault 1 (the initial offering of the encryption application), which only encrypts a user's home folder and not the entire disk. This must be enabled per user on that device and will still leave any data not stored within an encrypted home folder available to unauthorized access.\nThe good news is that as long as your Apple computer supports a recent version of OS X or the modern releases of macOS, you can upgrade your Mac's operating system at anytime to a newer version to enjoy the benefits of FileVault 2's enhanced security.\nAdditional resources\nFor the latest IT security news, tips, and downloads, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

The fiber internet pioneer launched in three new cities\u2014Huntsville, AL, Louisville, KY, and San Antonio, TX\u2014this year. It also began to heavily rely on shallow trenching, a new method of laying cables, to expedite the construction process.\nSEE: Photos: How Google Fiber is using'shallow trenching' to outbuild its gigabit rivals\n\"We're very pleased with the response from residents in these markets\u2014along with our other existing Google Fiber cities, where we worked hard throughout the year to bring Fiber service to even more people in many more neighborhoods,\" a Google Fiber spokesperson told TechRepublic.\nThe comeback happened after a construction halt and the CEO stepping down in October 2016, which left some wondering if Fiber was on its last breath.\nSEE: Internet and Email usage policy (Tech Pro Research)\nBut 2017 wasn't entirely a year of redemption. In February, hundreds of Fiber employees were moved to new jobs at Google. And Gregory McCray left the role of CEO in July after only holding the position for five months.\nAnd internet experts still have their doubts. Chris Antlitz, a senior analyst at Technology Business Research, labelled Fiber's year as \"not very good.\" Jim Hayes, president of the Fiber Optic Association, called Google Fiber a \"very distant player\" in the fiber market.\nHowever, Antlitz added that, for Alphabet\u2014the parent company of both Google and Google Fiber\u2014that means they're just not growing as fast as they wanted to. Google Fiber has still had an impact this year, he said.\nFiber set a new bar for broadband by showing incumbent internet service providers (ISPs) that it is economically feasible to bring 1 gigabit internet to consumers, Antlitz said. Since Google Fiber led a connectivity renaissance in 2011 when it launched in its first city, Kansas City, KS, top telecom providers have been in an arms race to upgrade their broadband pipes to accommodate 1 gigabit, Antlitz said.\nGoogle Fiber's presence in the market has caused competition that has forced other fiber providers like Verizon and AT&T Fiber to offer cheaper, faster service. Adding a second provider to a market can reduce prices by around one-third, according to a study by the Fiber to the Home Council.\nSEE: Google Fiber 2.0 targets the city where it will stage its comeback, as AT&T Fiber prepares to go nuclear\nAT&T has been particularly competitive, analysts say. They've been expanding in current and prospective Google Fiber cities, including adding new neighborhoods in San Antonio months before Google Fiber arrived.\nIn Louisville, AT&T sued the Louisville Metro Government over its \"One Touch Make Ready\" ordinance, which allows Google to use existing poles to install its technology without permission from the telecom company that owned the poles. The lawsuit was dismissed in August, and AT&T said it wouldn't appeal the dismissal in October.\nA TechRepublic investigation found that AT&T has talked a big game about its buildout in Louisville, but has dragged its feet in rolling out gigabit internet to customers and has signed up very few households. It's this kind of activity that has gotten AT&T's gigabit strategy labeled \"fiber-to-the-press-release.\"\nIt's unclear what Google Fiber's 2018 will look like. The company's map of Fiber cities doesn't yet list an upcoming city where Fiber will be heading next. Six potential cities\u2014Portland, OR, San Jose, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Dallas, TX, Oklahoma City, OK, Tampa, FL, Jacksonville, FL, Phoenix, AZ\u2014are listed as places the company is exploring.\nSEE: Louisville and the Future of the Smart City (a ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\nWilliam Hahn, an analyst at Gartner, said going to even one-third of those cities next year would be impressive for Google Fiber. However, he said he doesn't foresee a shift in the market in the next two years. The next big gamechanger? The rollout of 5G, which will give providers more wireless to potentially play with in cities and hard-to-reach rural areas. In five US cities in 2018, Verizon plans to roll out 5G fixed wireless, which will compete directly with fiber in speed and low latency.\nAntlitz said it's probable that Fiber will collaborate with incumbent ISPs to target unserved and underserved communities, including those in emerging markets and harder-to-reach rural spots.\n\"I think they don't want to be an ISP,\" Antlitz said. \"They're trying to prove a point.\"\nThe point? That faster, 1 gigabit internet can be affordable\u2014and that the existing ISPs just needed a push.\n\"They got what they wanted,\" Antlitz added.\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Next Big Thing newsletter.

We played the role of skeptic.\nSEE: Virtualization policy (Tech Pro Research)\nTechRepublic: We think we understand what hyperconverged infrastructure means, but how would you explain it?\nZeus Kerravala: \"It's kind of a weird term. There was already a converged infrastructure market [lacking the software aspect] when this technology came around. Hyperconverged platforms are turnkey products that include all the hardware and software one needs to run a contained little data center in a box.... When you look at running data center infrastructure there's a lot of different choices for buyers. If you use Cisco networking, EMC storage, and Dell computing, which is a pretty standard thing, there's over 800 configurations. [In HCI] the vendor's done all the heavy lifting. They're not plug-and-play... it's data center technology, nothing's ever going to be plug-and-play. But customers have told me the deployment time for these is days vs. months if you're trying to cobble it all together yourself.\"\nSEE: The cloud v. data center decision (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\nTechRepublic: Do you think most corporate sysadmins and CIOs understand this?\nZeus Kerravala: \"I'm not sure the CIO does. I think technology has been somewhat niche. It's been used primarily for virtual desktop deployments. Those are workloads that tend to be demanding... unified communications are a likely next thing. I don't really understand where the 'hyper' came from, to be honest with you.\"\nTechRepublic: Most good ideas in information technology are cyclical. How much of this is truly novel and how much is just a new name?\nZeus Kerravala: \"We used to have converged platforms a long time ago, and we called them mainframes. The reason the hyperconverged market exists is to simplify the deployment of all the stuff we need to run data centers.\"\nTechRepublic: Why is this happening now?\nZeus Kerravala: \"I talk to CIOs. More and more, CIOs are less concerned about the technical aspects of running stuff. They want stuff to work so they can run the business. There's a theme of digital transformation that's cutting across all businesses. If you talk to a CEO about running a business, it's about speed today. It's Darwinism.\"\nSEE: Digital transformation: A CXO's guide (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\nTechRepublic: What are the risks of changing from traditional to hyperconverged infrastructure?\nZeus Kerravala: \"I haven't really talked to anyone who hasn't had a good experience [except] using the technology for the wrong workloads. If you're going to run hyperconverged infrastructure, the development has to be done on a product that's at least similar from a hardware perspective.\"\nTechRepublic: What about hardware upgrades?\nZeus Kerravala: \"Applications that have the most demanding hardware requirements, I'd probably keep those on a platform that I have a little bit of control over, and I can upgrade the processors when I need to. If you wouldn't run it on a virtual machine, then certainly don't run it on this.\"\nTechRepublic: Which companies are offering hyperconverged infrastructure the right way?\nZeus Kerravala: \"The market leader right now in terms of brand and share is still Nutanix. They've done a lot of work in software. The one to watch is Dell/EMC but for specific use cases [such as with VMware's vSphere]. If your hypervisor is Microsoft or Citrix, then I might look at a different platform... 8kpc is a startup. They've done a lot of work on the hardware optimization phase.\"\nTechRepublic: Which companies aren't doing so well at it?\nZeus Kerravala: \"I think HPE is bit of a confused company right now... Lenovo is another one that I've expected more of by now.\"\nTechRepublic: What is your advice for customers considering a hyperconverged infrastructure product?\nZeus Kerravala: \"There's a lot of products on the market and they all kind of pitch the same message. But the performance from box to box, from vendor to vendor, is going to be quite different depending on what you're running on it. Do your own testing. How does it work in a hybrid cloud situation? I'd also want to know from a roadmap perspective about flash storage, 100Gb Ethernet, and then NVMe.\"\nTechRepublic: What else should people know?\nZeus Kerravala: \"Try to have a good understanding of what it means to the operational team.

Here are the big takeaways:\nBusiness professionals could gain from wearing a wearable device, but some have more fitness features than business features.\nProfessionals should look for wearables with different ways to stay connected, basic activity tracking, and a fashion-forward look.\nWearables, like smartwatches and fitness trackers, are popular with business professionals, and for good reason. The devices can collect data and provide insights, allowing wearers to track their fitness and productivity to reach their goals faster.\nBut some devices may not work the best for business professionals. They may not have enough ways to stay connected in terms of communications, or they may be too focused on physical goals like meditation. And some may stand out too much for professionals in formal business attire to feel comfortable wearing them.\nSEE: Wearable Device Policy (Tech Pro Research)\nHow to choose a wearable for business\nConnectivity is the first thing to consider when selecting a wearable for business purposes. Some options can connect to a smartphone, while others work outside of a cellular network. Some professionals need constant access to business communication, and selecting a wearable that works in tandem with a smartphone can provide that.\nThink about what you want to accomplish with your wearable. Do you want to just be able to see notifications, or do you need to be able to answer texts and emails as well? What about activity tracking? It can help you understand how you spend your hours to find ways to become more productive, or you can use it for fitness purposes as well.\nApps and integrations can be helpful for business professionals, so check out what is available. Some, especially ones connected to a smartphone, have multiple options, while others have fewer choices. Integrations can streamline things between your wearable and other devices, potentially making you more efficient. Apps can offer new ways to boost productivity.\nMindfulness features are also helpful, especially in high-stress jobs or industries. A sleep tracker can help understand if you're sleeping long or well enough.\nFinally, looks aren't everything, but some wearables can stand out when worn with business attire. More wearables are adopting the look of traditional watches, with leather bands and sleek faces. A wearable won't do much if you don't wear it because of its look.\nHow to choose a wearable for fitness\nFirst, you should consider if you want one device to carry from work to the gym, or if you want separate options. Some popular devices, like the Apple Watch, can work for both environments due to the amount of features and connectivity options.\nMuch like with business wearables, you need to consider what exactly the fitness tracker needs to do. Most will offer the same baseline metrics, but others offer more analytics. How much insight do you want into your workouts? Some only need simple step tracking, but someone training for a marathon may need more detail.\nIn what physical environment are you going to use the device? Whatever the answer, the tracker should be ready. For example, if you're a swimmer, you obviously need a water-resistant device. Runners may want a device with a built-in GPS so they can track their runs.\nYou should also consider the tracker's connected app, if it has one. What analysis and insights can you get on the app? Does it have features to track food and water intake? Like with business wearables, integrations may also be important, so review the offerings.\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

Some people pursue #NoEmail\u2014and start to treat email as an ephemeral communication channel instead of a permanent archive.\nBefore you start to mass delete items from Gmail, I recommend that you export your current email data. To do this, use Google Takeout at https://takeout.google.com. Choose the \"Select None\" button, then scroll down the page to Mail. Move the slider to the right of Mail to \"on.\" (You may export just some of your email: Select the down arrow to the left of the slider, then choose one\u2014or more\u2014Gmail labels to select items tagged with those labels to export.)\nSelect Next at the bottom of the page, then choose the format, file sizes, and storage action for your export. Wait to start your deletions until you've either downloaded or verified that your exported email has been stored. (Note: If you use G Suite, an administrator has the ability to disable access to Takeout. If that's the case, talk with your administrator about backup before you begin.)\nAfter you backup, cycle through the following four steps to move sets of email to the Gmail trash.\n1. Search\nI've found that typing search terms into the Gmail search box in the desktop Chrome browser to be the most efficient way to find and select sets of emails. And while Google gives you a long list of search operators, I suggest you start with the following:\nEmail address. Enter to: or from: followed by an email address to find all of the email sent to or received from an address.\n. Enter to: or from: followed by an email address to find all of the email sent to or received from an address. Subject. Enter subject: followed by a word (or a phrase in quotes) to find all email that contains the word or phrase specified.\n. Enter subject: followed by a word (or a phrase in quotes) to find all email that contains the word or phrase specified. Date. While there are several time-search options, try before: or older_than: first. The first locates items prior to a specified data, while the latter locates item older than a certain number of days, months, or years (e.g., 3d, 1m, or 7y for 3 days, 1 month, or 7 years, respectively) from the current date.\n. While there are several time-search options, try before: or older_than: first. The first locates items prior to a specified data, while the latter locates item older than a certain number of days, months, or years (e.g., 3d, 1m, or 7y for 3 days, 1 month, or 7 years, respectively) from the current date. Size. Locates email larger than a specific size. For example, larger:20M finds items larger than 20Mb.\nOften a simple search may be all you need to locate a set of email you no longer need. For example, you might not need to keep receipts from some vendors (email address), accepted calendar invitations (subject), email older than 3 years (date), or large files (size) stored elsewhere.\n2. Review and refine\nReview the search results to see if you wish to keep email found with a simple search. If no, move on to step no. 3.\nIf you see emails that you wish to keep among the results, you'll need to refine your search. You can combine multiple search terms. For example, search for both an email address and a date:\nfrom:andy@pa311.com older_than:1y\nThis would find items older than one year from the current day. Or, add a subject as well, to narrow the results further:\nfrom:andy@pa311.com older_than:1y subject:\"Weekly meeting\"\nYou may use the - character to exclude a search term (or terms). For example:\nto:andy@pa311.com older_than:1y -subject:\"Quarterly review\"\nThis would find items older than a year sent to a specific email address, but would exclude any emails with the subject \"Quarterly review.\"\nIf more than one screen of results is indicated, select the arrow in the upper right area to review additional screens of email search results.\nRefine and review the results until you're confident that all the email found by your search is email you wish to delete.\n3. Select / Select All\nSelect the box at the top of the column above your email search results to select all of the email displayed.\nIf your search returns more email than is displayed on the current screen, you'll see a message above the list of email that gives you the option to \"Select all conversations that match this search.\" Click the words to select all conversations that match your search terms.\n4. Move to Trash\nSelect the trashcan icon to delete the selected email.\nRepeat for various terms\nRepeat your search to find, select, and delete as many sets of email as you wish. When I help people get control of their email we often search for things such as:\nOld promotional emails, newsletters, and updates\nEmail no longer needed from specific clients, vendors, or colleagues\nSystem status notices (e.g., update notifications and system down/up notifications)\nOutdated social media or account sign-in notifications\nEmail related to prior jobs (including paid and volunteer roles)\nTip: Use a label to exclude a set from a search\nOften, I find it helpful to label a set of email so that I can always exclude that set of email when I work through the email deletion process. For example, you might want to keep all email from a specific person (or several people).\nTo do this, first create a Gmail label, such as \"Never delete.\" Then, search for a colleague's email address. Select all email with that person, then select the label icon, choose the label you created (e.g., \"Never delete\"), then select \"Apply\" at the bottom of the column. Repeat this process for as many criteria as you wish\nThen, when you do searches, always exclude labels that match the selected set. For example:\nolder_than:1y -label:\"Never delete\"\nThis would return all emails older than a year, while excluding all emails labeled \"Never delete.\"\nOptional: Delete Trash\nAt this point, you're done. Gmail will remove items left in the trash after 30 days. If you really want things deleted now, you can always navigate to the trash, select all items (and select all items in the trash), then choose \"Delete forever.\"\n\u00d7 e-gmail-auto-delete-vault-search.jpg\nG Suite controls\nA G Suite administrator has at least two significant options available to manage mail, as well. First, an administrator can set a Gmail auto-delete policy (from admin.google.com, sign-in, then Apps > G Suite > Gmail > Advanced settings > Compliance: Email and chat auto-deletion) for messages to either be moved to trash or deleted after a specified number of days.\nThe administrator also may specify that emails with a specific label (or labels) will not be auto-deleted. Second, a G Suite administrator can configure Google Vault, which gives the organization a sophisticated set of controls to preserve, search, and export email communications for legal and/or compliance purposes. (Vault is included with Business and Enterprise edition licenses.)\nYour thoughts?\nDo you maintain a pristine, close-to-zero Gmail inbox? Or do you archive everything forever?

According to a Google blog post, the API is getting a new feature called word-level timestamps, along with support for 30 new languages and three hour files.\nFor those unfamiliar, the Google Cloud Speech API uses neural network models to allow developers to convert audio to text. It's powered by machine learning, and can return its results in real-time.\nWord-level timestamps, the post said, was the most requested feature for the API from developers. Essentially, this feature adds a timestamp for each word it identifies in a given transcription. \"Word-level timestamps let users jump to the moment in the audio where the text was spoken, or display the relevant text while the audio is playing,\" the post said.\nSEE: How we learned to talk to computers, and how they learned to answer back (PDF download)\nOne of the customers cited in the post, Happy Scribe, uses the word-level timestamps to lower the time it takes for them to proofread the transcriptions they offer their customers. Another firm, VoxImplant, uses it to better analyze recorded phone conversations between two parties.\nAs part of a broader announcement around Google's voice input capabilities, the Cloud Speech API will now offer support for 30 additional languages, bringing the total number supported up to 119. The languages will first be offered to Cloud Speech API customers, but will eventually be supported on other Google products, like Gboard, as well.\nAs noted by ZDnet's Stephanie Condon, the extended language support could help Google win over some customers in emerging markets.\nThe full list of languages that work with the Cloud Speech API can be found here.\nAdditionally, the post said, the Cloud Speech API will now support files that are longer than three hours in duration, an increase from the previous limit of 80 minutes.

Since encryption isn't a failproof technology, building it in can lead to more data breaches and crime because it's facilitating a much less secure internet, she said.\nThe policy requested by Turnbull affects the rest of the world because Australia's encryption policy could set a precedent for other countries. Stepanovich noted that it's important to understand that this policy would likely not stop criminals or terrorists from accessing secure communications technologies. The math used in encrypted applications, she said, is not subject to the whims of politicians, which means bad actors will still be able to cover their tracks.\nSee: Encryption Policy (Tech Pro Research)\nIn the past, other governments have pursued similar policies. For example, some require keys to be stored in third-party facilities and are easily stolen. Some countries restrict the strength of encryption or even prevent the use of end-to-end encryption.

In short, the AI and analytics become a second pair of eyes for radiologists against which they can cross-check their own diagnoses.\nHow important is this?\n\"In many rural areas in China, there are no trained radiologists who can help stroke victims,\" said Chen. \"And in other areas of the world, like the US, radiologists make an average of $375,000 a year, so they are very expensive.\"\nChen says that the feedback he gets from hospitals is that younger radiologists and medical practitioners rely heavily on AI, while older practitioners prefer to use it as a second opinion that they cross-check against their own.\n\"In a stroke, you want to respond to the condition as quickly as possible,\" said Chen. \"It might take 30 to 35 seconds in a standard process to generate a report on the condition so treatment can be determined. With our tool, that time is cut to less than three seconds.\"\nThe use of deep learning and expanded analytics also expand the spectrum of diagnosis, which can lead to better results.\n\"In one non-stroke case that involved diagnosis and treatment of a bone fracture and a degenerated area of bone, the standard approach is to treat the affected area itself,\" said Chen. \"With analytics and AI, a system can focus on different areas of the body that are far removed from where the problem is to see if these other areas could be affecting the condition. If it is a problem that is being generated far from the fracture itself, the analytics allow us to treat causes of the condition, and not just symptoms.\"\nSEE: How to implement AI and machine learning (free PDF) (ZDNet/TechRepublic special report)\nHere are some best practices hospitals and clinics can adopt as AI and deep learning tools evolve:\nDeploy the tool where help is needed most\nIf there is an acute shortage of medical practitioners in a specific region, analytics and AI can help in situations like stroke intervention and treatment, and the chances for success for patients will improve.\nUse the tool for training\nRadiologists and medical practitioners must develop knowledge and experience before they can become expert diagnosticians. An analytics and deep learning tool can assist in the training process because users can compare their own findings against what the system finds in numerous scenarios.\nLearn to expect the unexpected\nYou might think you are going to treat one condition and end up treating another. The bone fracture that Chen mentioned, where the system actually found the causal problem in a different area of the body, is a prime example. This is why medical practitioners should keep their minds open.\nNever forget that AI and deep learning tools are still developing\nJust because a system uses AI, deep learning and analytics doesn't mean that is it always right. Medical practitioners should use these systems as assistants and not as undisputed authorities, because there are some areas where a machine can't be a replacement for human thought and reasoning.\nFor more about AI, big data, and the latest innovations, subscribe to our Next Big Thing newsletter.

Here are the big takeaways:\nA new stripped-down Windows 10 build called \"Lean\" was discovered in the latest Insider preview of Windows 10. It lacks many Windows 10 features and has a 2GB smaller installation size.\nMicrosoft hasn't said what Lean's purpose is, but it appears to be for lower-end machines or those that need to be locked down from user tampering.\nMicrosoft's latest Windows Insider skip ahead build contains a new version of Windows 10 called Windows 10 Lean, which cuts the installation size by 2 GB.\nDiscovered by Twitter user Lucan, Windows 10 Lean cuts out several Windows 10 features: desktop wallpaper is disabled by default, the Microsoft Management Console and registry editor are missing, drivers for CD and DVD drives can't be installed, Microsoft Edge doesn't allow downloads, and Microsoft Office is missing as well.\nAt first glance it may seem that Windows 10 Lean is an alternative to Windows 10 S (which only allows app installation from the Windows Store), but Lucan quickly dismissed that by saying that those restrictions don't apply, as he was able to run applications normally locked to Windows 10 S users.\nWhat is Windows 10 Lean's purpose?\nThe Twitter discussion growing up around Lucan's discovery of Windows 10 Lean is devoid of one important thing: an explanation as to its purpose.\nMary Jo Foley from TechRepublic sister site ZDNet speculated that it was a version of Windows 10 S for home or enterprise, but Lucan said he doesn't think that's the case. Windows 10 S, he said, is more like a set of restrictions on top of a standard Windows 10 install, which Lean definitely isn't.\nAnother Twitter commenter said it may be ideal for educational use, as schools often have older computers that need a smaller install. Add to that the heavy restrictions on what a user can do in Windows 10 Lean (no downloading, no Regedit, etc.) and you have a relatively resilient OS that has lower-end hardware requirements.\nSEE: Securing Windows policy (Tech Pro Research)\nWIndows 10 Lean could make a great OS for any systems that see a lot of user contact: Loaner machines, kiosks, sales floor demos, and other specific roles would be a great fit for Lean.\nAnyone who has ever managed computers that see a lot of public contact knows they have to be locked down, and Windows 10 Lean seems designed for that particular purpose. There are a lot of things users can't do in a base install of Lean, leaving it up to an administrator to pre-load an installation with certain software or settings that would be largely unalterable.\nGiven the limits of WIndows 10 Lean it's likely that it's designed to save space, be a quick install, and be customized as an image prior to being installed. Lean images could be configured to suit specific roles, and users would be largely unable to damage them.\nWe won't know what Windows 10 Lean is really designed for until Microsoft says so, but If you want to check it out now you can do so in Redstone 5 Insider preview build 17650, available now to Windows Insider members.\nGet a roundup of the biggest Microsoft news of the week in your inbox: Subscribe to our Microsoft Weekly newsletter.

My goal was to sift through the chaff and find something that would key me into understanding what was at the core of the PH-1. It didn't take long for a common thread to bubble up from the surface. That thread? A less-than stellar camera. The good news for me was that I don't consider a smartphone's primary function to be taking photos, so having the best camera available wasn't a top priority.\nWith that out of the way, it seemed the PH-1 met all of my needs, and did so at a price point that was right on the money. And thus, I made the purchase, and set aside my OnePlus 3 to embark on a journey with the newest underdog.\nAs many of you know, I'm a big fan of the underdog. I've been using Linux as my primary OS for decades, so I'm accustomed to watching a platform scrape and dig for attention and respect. However, after just two weeks of use, I'm convinced the PH-1 shouldn't be considered an underdog but a top dog, in a class by itself.\nThat's not to say it's perfect because it's not, but no device is (and anyone who believes otherwise is kidding themselves).\nNow that I've had plenty of time to experience Essential's first foray into the smartphone market, I feel like I have plenty to say about the device. And, with that said, let's dive into the good and the bad.\nSEE: Mobile device computing policy (Tech Pro Research)\nThe bad\nI thought I'd flip the script and start with the bad. Why? Because there isn't much in the way of bad to be found. In fact, I have to trick myself into thinking \"Maybe photos are more important than I originally thought!\" before I can really come up with something negative of note to say about the PH-1.\nIt has been well documented that the Essential Phone's camera is lackluster. The software is a bit slow, and the low-light photos are far from great. The selfie camera also suffers from the software issues that hinder the main camera.\nHowever, after four updates (that's right, four updates since I received the device, more on that in a bit), I've watched the camera app improve exponentially. It's still not nearly as good as the Pixel 2 camera app for instance, but it's passible. For anyone that doesn't consider photos to be a priority, the camera app will suffice.\nThe only other nit to pick is that the gorgeous case is the biggest fingerprint magnet I've ever seen. I'm constantly wiping the back down. Had this phone not been nearly as beautiful as it is, the fingerprints wouldn't concern me. But the PH-1 is one of the most elegant smartphones I have ever held in my hand, so my propensity is to keep it clean. Essential should be cleaning up in awards for hardware design\u2014of that there is no doubt.\nFinally, there is no headphone jack. That's okay for two reasons: Bluetooth headphones have come a very long way, and Essential included the necessary dongle so users won't have to toss their standard headphones or other devices that might make use of that common interface.\nAnd that's it for the bad.\nThe good\nThere is almost too much to say here, so I'm going to boil it down to a few \"essential\" items.\nFirst and foremost: the design. As I said, it's gorgeous. But even the titanium sides and ceramic back take a seat to the display. No it's not the most cutting edge (Essential went with an LCD display, instead of the more popular, flagship level, OLED option), but the edge to edge is absolutely beautiful. Essential essentially proved that a bezel-less device is very much possible and their home screen launcher makes perfect use of the screen real estate (Figure A).\nFigure A\nThe one downfall is that not every app found in the Google Play Store makes use of that full screen. To Essential's credit, so far I've only found one app that didn't\u2014Discogs (Figure B).\nFigure B\nBeyond the hardware, there's the stock Android (shipping with Android 7.1.1). If you're looking for nothing but essential Android, the PH-1 delivers. Upon arrival the device included the bare minimum software. There was zero bloat. Couple that with the speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, and that barebones Android runs as smoothly as any flagship device. Period. Apps install quickly, start instantly, and run smoothly. The PH-1 easily stands toe-to-toe with my wife's Samsung Galaxy S8.\nOne very crucial aspect many users will appreciate is how quickly the PH-1 receives the Android Security Patch. Since initially turning on the device, my PH-1 has received four Android updates. Even though the device is running Android 7.1.1, it enjoys the most recent Security Patch (Figure C).\nFigure C\nThe combination of beautiful and powerful hardware, and up-to-date barebones software make for an incredible experience.\nWho's the ideal PH-1 user?\nLet's make this easy:\nIf you're tired of devices shipping with bloat\u2014and who isn't\u2014the PH-1 might be the ideal device for you.\nIf you're constantly on-the-go, the titanium case is strong enough to withstand your brutal abuse.\nIf you're a fan of the underdog, the PH-1 is the perfect smartphone for you. The ratio of price to performance will absolutely blow you away. No other smartphone, regardless of manufacturer, enjoys this level of form and function. Essential has every right to stand with the leaders in the industry. It's every bit as cool as the iPhone X and as flexible as any Android device\u2014all without the price found with most flagship smartphones.\nIf you like your devices to turn heads, the PH-1 is the perfect mix of brawn, brains, and beauty. The look of the PH-1 draws onlookers in, and the performance locks them in. The second you hold the PH-1 in your hand you'll know you've purchased a quality product. This is a flagship smartphone, there's no doubt.\nWhat more needs to be said?\nBravo Essential, you've created something special.\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more news and tips.

Uber has since temporarily stopped its self-driving operations in Tempe and all other cities where it has been testing its vehicles, including Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Toronto.\nThe vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the accident, with a vehicle operator behind the wheel, according to a statement from the Tempe police.\nMore about autonomous vehicles Special report: Tech and the future of transportation (free PDF) This ebook, based on the latest special feature from ZDNet and TechRepublic, looks at emerging autonomous transport technologies and how they will affect society and the future of business.

However, autonomous vehicles have been involved in a number of other accidents, including backing into a delivery truck in Las Vegas and getting hit by another car whose human driver did not yield in Tempe, both in 2017.\nIn May 2016, a Tesla driver was killed in an accident while the car was operating in its semi-autonomous Autopilot mode. A US Department of Transportation investigation did not identify any defects in design or performance of the Autopilot system.\nThe pedestrian fatality could have immediate implications for the rollout of self-driving taxis and delivery vehicles, which are predicted by many to be the first widespread applications of self-driving technology. It could mean that progress is slowed until more regulations are in place.\nThe accident could also impact discussions around how autonomous vehicles will change auto insurance. KPMG estimates that the technology will lead to an 80% drop in accident frequency by 2040, and that providers will need to shift from covering the car itself to the software of the car. It remains to be seen how coverage of accidents like this may change.\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

Here are the big takeaways:\nIBM launched IBM Watson Data Kits, designed to speed the development of AI applications in the enterprise.\nEnterprise AI apps created with IBM Watson Data Kits have the potential to aid in faster, more informed decision making for business leaders.\nOn Tuesday, IBM launched IBM Watson Data Kits, designed to speed the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the enterprise. These apps have the potential to aid in faster, more informed decision making for business leaders, according to a press release.\n\"Watson Data Kits will provide companies across industries with pre-enriched, machine readable, industry-specific data that can enable them to scale AI across their business,\" the release said.\nIn Q2, Watson Data Kits will become available for the travel, transportation, and food industries, with kits for travel points of interest and food menus. Kits tailored for additional industries are also expected in the coming months, the release noted.\nSEE: The Power of IoT and Big Data (Tech Pro Research)\nMore than half of data scientists said they spend most of their time on janitorial tasks, such as cleaning and organizing data, labeling data, and collecting data sets, according to a CrowdFlower report, making it difficult for business leaders to implement AI technology at scale. Streamlining and accelerating the development process for AI engineers and data scientists will help companies more quickly gain insights from their data, and drive greater business value, according to IBM.\n\"Big data is fueling the cognitive era. However, businesses need the right data to truly drive innovation,\" Kristen Lauria, general manager of Watson media and content, said in the release. \"IBM Watson Data Kits can help bridge that gap by providing the machine-readable, pre-trained data companies require to accelerate AI development and lead to a faster time to insight and value. Data is hard, but Watson can make it easier for stakeholders at every level, from CIOs to data scientists.\"\nThe Watson Data Kit for travel points of interest will offer airlines, hotels, and online travel agencies with more than 300,000 points of interest in 100 categories, to create better experiences for travelers, according to the release. Companies in the travel and transportation industry can use the kits to build AI-powered web and mobile apps to help users find information on points of interest in a given area. For example, the release noted, a hospitality company could use the data kit to train AI powering its chatbot to recommend personalized destinations based on a customer's individual preferences.\nMeanwhile, the Watson Data Kit for food menus includes 700,000 menus in 21,000 US cities, according to the release. This will offer AI developers content for apps that can help users filter menu items, types of food, locations, and price points. The kit allows developers to build in side-by-side comparisons of menu choices and prices. For example, the release noted, the kit could be integrated into a car's navigation system to provide voice-activated directions to the closest bakery that sells gluten-free muffins.\nStay up to date on all the latest big data news.

About 17 million of those trek out to stadiums each season\u2014which means over 90% of NFL fans are catching the games on TV, online and mobile. That's why NFL games represented 37 of the top 50 highest-rated television broadcasts of 2017.\nA lot of the appeal of football is that it's not just about the long throws of quarterbacks, the bullish strength of defensive lineman, and the lightning-fast reflexes of wide receivers, for example. It's about the chess match between the coaches, and the preparation, instincts, and quick decision-making of the smartest players.\nBut while these athletic feats are amazing to watch and easy to recognize, it's often a lot harder to pinpoint the strategies and the smarts that tip a game one way or the other.\nThat's where the NFL's Next Gen Stats\u2014a big partnership with Amazon Web Services\u2014is changing how the game is understood, using a combination of cloud computing, big data analytics, and machine learning.\n\"We've been turning a corner on creating metrics that are more advanced and do a better job of telling the story of the game,\" Matt Swensson, the NFL's vice president of emerging products and technology, told TechRepublic.\nSEE: Big data policy (Tech Pro Research) | Job description: Chief data officer (Tech Pro Research) | Job description: Data scientist (Tech Pro Research)\nThe NFL has been keeping statistics since 1920. But most of the stats that it displays to the public had been pretty standard for the past several decades. It was the kind of stuff you see on trading cards and game programs\u2014yards passing, yards rushing, catches, tackles, quarterback sacks, interceptions, etc.\nBut in 2015, it began putting a pair of RFID tags from Zebra Technologies on the shoulder pads of every NFL player in order to track speed, field location, and movement patterns. Now, it also has sensors on the referees, first down markers, and end zone pylons.\nHow to fully take advantage of all this data and convert it into value for the NFL and its customers was the big challenge.\nWhen Amazon learned that the NFL now had all this player telemetry data, the AWS team suggested that they could help create more value with analytics\u2014similar to what AWS had famously done with Major League Baseball Advanced Media.\n\"We started working with [the NFL] to help them apply machine learning to that data,\" AWS vice president of marketing Ariel Kelman told TechRepublic. \"They're recording things like when the ball was snapped, what the formation was, how many of which type of player was on the field, what the result of the play was. A lot of that is pattern recognition... The idea is there's a whole bunch of things that require manual detection and tagging that they want to be able to automate.\"\nSo AWS and the NFL drew up a partnership where the NFL used the Amazon cloud, its advanced analytics tools and the new SageMaker machine learning product\u2014while Amazon got to slap the AWS logo on Next Gen Stats as the official sponsor and get a bunch of promotional opportunities that show off what its big data tools can do.\nThe deal kicked off about six months ago, before the start of the 2017 football season, and culminates on Sunday in Super Bowl LII\u2014although both the AWS and NFL folks were even more excited about what they're going to be able to do with the data next year.\nHere are the three main ways it's changing the game:\n1. The impact of Next Gen Stats on NFL teams\nOne week of NFL games now creates 3TB of data, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle said in her presentation at Amazon's re:Invent conference last November. After each game, the league now exports a trove of data to each team to help them evaluate their overall performance and their players. The league provides some basic tools to help the teams evaluate the data along with a few basic insights. Some teams have their own data scientists or analytics partners to take it further.\nThe teams are using the data to help inform their training, fitness, and game preparation. But there's one big caveat that's keeping them from using the data to plan game strategies and draw up plays.\n\"Right now clubs are getting just their side of the ball, and so that's a decision point that's coming up,\" said the NFL's Swensson. \"We want to be able to ultimately get to a place where both sides of the ball are available to clubs, so they can do a lot more interesting analysis.\"\nIn other words, teams don't get their opponents' in-depth data or the patterns that machine learning can see. That's a big topic for the NFL in the upcoming off-season, and it's an issue that's up for consideration by the NFL Competition Committee.\nImage: NFL\n2. The impact of Next Gen Stats on NFL broadcasts\nThe place where Next Gen Stats has made its most visible impact is on the television broadcasts of NFL games by CBS Sports (both TechRepublic and CBS Sports are owned by CBS). AWS has brought the data visualizations of Next Gen Stats into CBS broadcasts and given CBS analysts data points to explain some of the most important plays in the game. AWS is also working with the NFL's other broadcast partners to bring similar capabilities next season.\nSome of the Next Gen Stats that analysts now have access to include, for example:\nReal-time location data on all of the players\nPlayer speed and acceleration\nTotal running distance for each player for the entire game\nThe amount of separation that receivers get from their defenders\nThe pressure rate that defenses have on quarterbacks\nPercentage of quarterback throws into tight windows\nAnnouncers such as former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo\u2014a new color commentator at CBS this season\u2014have embraced the data and used it to help give viewers an inside look at why some of the plays on the field succeed and others don't.\n\"We're working with the guys in production at CBS Sports to try and evolve it to really make the fan experience better. It's early days. What we've learned from baseball is the way to present this data,\" said Amazon's Kelman.\n\"We're looking forward to taking it to the next level next season.\"\n3. The impact of Next Gen Stats on NFL fans\nFor fans, the NFL has launched nextgenstats.nfl.com as a portal to view these new insights and data points. There are all kinds of new statistics that you've never seen on the back of a trading, such as:\nAverage Time to Throw (quarterbacks)\nAverage Completed Air Yards (quarterbacks)\nAggressiveness Percentage (quarterbacks)\nEfficiency (running backs)\n8+ Defenders in the Box (running backs)\nAverage Time Behind Line of Scrimmage (running backs)\nAverage Cushion (receivers)\nAverage Separation (receivers)\nAverage Targeted Air Yards (receivers)\nThe site also includes charts for quarterbacks, running backs, and receivers to see their patterns from their last game. In addition, the NFL publishes photo essays with specific insights from Next Gen Stats from the previous week's games, as well as videos that explain the differences and similarities between players, teams, and games based on the data.\n\"There's some very complicated parts of football that can be really fascinating to die hard fans,\" said Swensson. \"A lot of times you watch a game and maybe you don't realize some of the decisions and why they are made, or even some of the intricacies of the game such as why players line up a certain way. My hope is that [Next Gen Stats] continues to educate fans and help them understand more and more of our game.\"\nSEE: Turning Big Data into Business Insights (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\nThis stuff is obviously great source material for fantasy football junkies, but it can also fuel die-hard fans in their search to better understand the performance of their team and their favorite players\u2014which can also create greater customer loyalty for the NFL. The good news for fans is that the program is just getting off the ground.\n\"The stuff you see on the site now is just based off the tracking data and the splits we've been able to do based on location data, but not much pattern recognition,\" said Swensson. \"A lot of the machine learning stuff we've done, we haven't put up yet. Our plan is to launch that for next season.\"\nOf course, there's one more big game left this season. For the fans watching Super Bowl LII between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, here are a pair of Next Gen Stats videos that break down what's likely to be the game's key matchup:\nImage: NFL\nWhat other businesses can learn\n\"The typical conversation that we're having with customers around machine learning is that it is one of the top priorities,\" said Kelman. \"But, there is a huge gap in most of these companies between what they want to do and the skills of their people. It's kind of as simple as we have all this data, what should we do with machine learning? What problems should we point it at, and what kind of predictions should we make? The more examples that we can give our customers of what other people are doing, the better.\"\nSubscribe to TechRepublic's Big Data newsletter to keep up with the latest tips and best practices.

According to blog post, CVE-2017-0199 traditionally utilizes RTF documents, and this is the first time it has been seen to abuse PowerPoint Slide Show in the wild.\nThe malware comes in an email that appears to be from a company that manufactures cables. The email tells the recipient to see the order and asks for them to quote cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) and free on board (FOB) prices as well. Due to the targeted nature of the email, as the criminals are typically going after electronics companies, the post said, the email is being considered a spear phishing attack.\nIn the sample email provided by Trend Micro, the attachment is titled PO-483848.ppsx. In that case, PO could be short for purchase order, in an effort to increase the perceived legitimacy of the PowerPoint file.\nSEE: 10 ways to minimize fileless malware infections\nIf the victim opens the attached file, there will be no purchase order, not even any fake text attempting to be one. It simply reads: CVE-2017-8570. That's the name of another Microsoft vulnerability, the post said, but not the one that this particular malware is targeting.\nPowerPoint then initializes a script moniker and runs the malicious payload, the post said. If successful, it will download an XML file from the internet. Some JavaScript code in that XML file runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote access tool.\nAt this point, the attackers will be able to run remote commands on the victim's machine. \"The tool's capabilities are quite comprehensive, and includes a download & execute command, a keylogger, a screen logger, and recorders for both webcam and microphone,\" the post said.\nThe biggest issue for this given attack is the fact that it comes by way of a PowerPoint file. Most current detection methods focus on the RTF delivery method, so that means attackers utilizing the PPSX files could have an easier time avoiding antivirus detection, the post said.\nTo protect against attacks like this one, businesses should make sure that their systems are properly patched and updated to account for any known vulnerabilities. Also, users should be regularly educated on proper security hygiene and email etiquette.\nThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers\nA new spear phishing campaign is using PowerPoint files to exploit the CVE-2017-0199 and deliver malware to victims. If a user clicks on the attached file, it will run a remote access tool, and could allow attackers access to a user's keystrokes, screen, webcam, and microphone. IT should keep systems update and educate users on the proper behavior regarding attachments and emails from outside parties.\nStay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

It creates transparency and trust between parties so that trust is no longer needed, which is why industries such as real estate, finance, and advertising are beginning to use it. And now, Wikipedia's cofounder Larry Sanger wants blockchain to replace the free online encyclopedia.\nTechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Sanger to discuss why he joined Everipedia, and why the blockchain should replace Wikipedia.\nEveripediais the encyclopedia of everything, where topics are unrestricted, unlike on Wikipedia, Sanger said. More technically, it's a blockchain encyclopedia with a decentralized protocol for accessing and sharing knowledge.\nSEE: Cheat sheet: Blockchain\nA blockchain is a list of transactions, or a ledger, that can be used to represent a database. By putting all of Everipedia's content on the blockchain, it creates a transparency between writers and readers. When it's all set up, it will be possible for people to propose adding information to the blockchain, Sanger explained, and people who have tokens (which are earned by adding to the blockchain) come to a consensus about what information gets added to the blockchain.\n\"In terms of editorial standards, just to get on an encyclopedia blockchain will be relatively easy,\" Sanger said. When the initial protocol is adopted, it should be a very low bar that allows encyclopedia articles to get onto the blockchain, he said. However, the actual editorial decisions that are made won't happen on that level.\nDifferent users of the information that make up the blockchain and Everipedia will make the decisions on the ratings of articles, and what order they will be placed. Users will be able to go in, read those articles, and visit our interface to submit their own ratings, he said.\nFind out The Next Big Thing and subscribe to TechRepublic's newsletter.

Users who choose to store iMessages in iCloud will free up device space and automatically sync iMessages across devices, but there is a trade-off: iCloud has been hacked before.\nThe more personal, or sensitive business, information you store in iCloud the more you stand to lose if your account is compromised.\nStoring iMessages in iCloud: How to do it safely\niOS users who want to store their iMessages in iCloud can do so with very few steps: Just open the Settings app, tap on your name, then on iCloud, and make sure the Messages option is toggled on. iOS will then offload all your iMessages to your iCloud storage space and you should see some freed up storage pretty quickly.\nIf your iCloud account were to be hacked, however, the attacker could gain access to all your iMessage conversations as well as the attachments they contain.\nThere's no surefire way to prevent your iCloud account from being compromised: If an attacker finds a backdoor in Apple's security (which happens with some degree of regularity) they will gain access, like it or not.\nSEE: Research: Defenses, response plans, and greatest concerns about cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (Tech Pro Research)\nThat doesn't mean you can't defend yourself. The simplest method is to enable two-factor authentication on your iCloud account. Two-factor authentication, like most other methods of cybersecurity, isn't foolproof but it's the best step you can take to avoid ending up like the dozens of celebrities who had their iCloud data stolen in 2014.\nA good rule of thumb when it comes to personal cloud storage services like iCloud is to avoid storing anything truly confidential in it. For business users this can be a variety of things\u2014proposals, internal use documents, and other records should only be stored in business-controlled cloud accounts.\nShould businesses allow iCloud syncing for iMessages?\nBusinesses that use iOS should be wary of allowing users to sync iMessages to iCloud: It's convenient, but it's simply too great a risk for companies concerned with data security.\nThe reason why businesses should prevent iCloud users from syncing messages is a matter of Apple's repeated security failures over the past several years. As mentioned in an article on TechRepublic sister site ZDNet, Apple's reputation has taken a big hit in the past few years, and a lot of that is due to its sloppy coding and high-profile software bugs.\nIf Apple wants business users to trust it with sensitive data it has some work to do on the security front. Until then, protect yourself by being careful what information\u2014including iMessages\u2014are stored in iCloud.\nYou can read the full iOS 11.4 patch notes here.\nThe big takeaways for tech leaders:\niOS 11.4 has been released, and one of its major new features is the ability to sync iMessages to iCloud.\nGiven Apple's recent, and repeated, security failings, business users should avoid trusting sensitive information to iCloud: It's better to wait and see if Apple steps up its security game.\nGet a roundup of the biggest Apple headlines by subscribing to our Apple Weekly newsletter.

That's not always suitable, so in this article, I'll show you a different model that tracks days using a columnar structure rather than the traditional row structure. This model supports projects, as many as you need. You probably won't find a magic bullet with either timesheet model, but you can adjust and customize either model to fit your needs.\nI'm using Excel 2016 (desktop) on a Windows 10 64-bit system, but you can use earlier versions. You can use the browser edition to enter your hours. For your convenience, you can download the demonstration.xlsx and.xls files.\n1. Determine your needs\nAs with any timesheet app that you plan to distribute, you need to consider the following issues:\nHow to validate input to eliminate typos and other invalid data. We'll use data validation in two spots.\nHow users will access the template. You can distribute it or allow them to access the sheet via a browser or web-based application. This article doesn't extend beyond a local or server file.\nHow to protect the template from misuse. Because this model uses a Table object to expand, Excel protection isn't helpful.\nHow to secure confidential information, such as social security numbers, if required. Our example doesn't contain any confidential data.\n2. The model\nFigure A shows the completed timesheet with all the trimmings. This model supports a seven-day week, beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday. Unlike the timesheet from the first article, this structure allows you to track hours specific to projects. You can easily adapt this structure to handle more than one week.\nFigure A\nWe'll create this simple timesheet that allows you to track time by projects.\nThe sheet has an input area for employee, company, and department information, including the time (pay) period. This model doesn't force you to \"clock in.\" Instead, users enter hours by category or project. As such, the user does bear bit more responsibility for tracking actual work hours throughout the day.\nSEE: Tap into the power of data validation in Excel (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n3. Limit the time period\nThe example uses Sunday to identify the pay period. You could enter a combo control that lists every Sunday of the year, but it would be cumbersome to use. Instead, we'll a validation control that accepts only Sunday dates:\nSelect B2. Click the Data tab click Data Validation in the Data Tools group, and then select the Data Validation option from the dropdown list. In the resulting dialog, choose Custom from the Allow dropdown. In the Formula control, enter the following formula (Figure B):\n=WEEKDAY($B$2,1)=1 If you like, click the Error Alert tab and enter a meaningful error message, as shown in Figure C. This step isn't necessary for the timesheet to work, but your users will appreciate the information. Click OK.\nFigure B\nUse a formula that accepts only Sunday dates.\nFigure C\nEnter a meaningful error message.\nFigure D shows the result of entering a date that isn't a Sunday. You could continue to limit input values, but we won't do so in this article.\nFigure D\nThe data validation control rejects invalid input dates.\n4. Automate the dates\nThis next step returns the dates in a single pay period by referencing the input date in B2. To start the sequence, enter the following expression in B5:\n=IF(B2<>\"\",B2,\"\")\nNext, enter the following expression in C5 and copy it to D5:H5:\n=IF(B5<>\"\",B5+1,\"\")\nTo extend the pay period, simply add more expressions to row 5. For now, the expressions return nothing because B2 is blank. Enter a Sunday date; initially, the expressions return serial values. Apply the Short Date format to B5:H5 to display meaningful dates, as shown in Figure E.\nFigure E\nFormat the expressions in row 5 to display dates.\n5. Add a projects list\nThe next few steps might be confusing as we implement them, but everything will come together in the end, so don't worry. Our structure supports projects, and you can specify as many projects as necessary in a simple list. Later, we'll add a data validation control that references this list.\nMove to a new sheet and enter the list shown in Figure F. Next, convert the list to a Table object so it requires no additional work to update:\nClick anywhere inside the list. Click the Insert tab and then click the Table option in the Tables group. In the resulting dialog (Figure F), indicate whether your Table has headers\u2014the example Table does. Click OK.\nFigure F\nConvert the list to a Table object so you can update it easily.\nYou can't directly reference a Table in a data validation control, so let's assign a defined name to the Table. First, we you need to know its name. Click inside the Table and then click the contextual Design tab. You'll find the Table object's name in the Table Name control to the left of the ribbon, as shown in Figure G. (It's often easier to work with a more meaningful name than the one Excel assigns. To rename the Table, click inside the Table Name control, enter a name and press Enter. We won't bother with this example.)\nFigure G\nDiscern the Table object's name.\nNow you're ready to assign a defined name to the Table as follows:\nClick anywhere inside the Table. Click the Formulas tab. In the Defined Names group, click Define Name. In the resulting dialog, enter ProjectList as the Name. Reference the Table using the format =Tablename[Columnheader]. In this case, that's =Table10[Projects], as shown in Figure H. Click OK.\nFigure H\nGive the Table a defined name.\nIt seems like you've gone to lot of extra work to create a simple list, but it's worth it. Because the list is a Table object, you can add and delete projects and the data validation control that we'll add later will automatically update, without any extra work on your part.\nSEE: 10 Excel time-savers you might not know about (TechRepublic)\n6. Add category input range\nWith your projects list in place you're ready to start building the work-hour input ranges. Beginning at A7, and using Figure I as a guide, add a row of header labels and category labels. Be sure to leave a blank row (row 6) between the information input range and the category input range. The white space will help reduce the visual noise.\nFigure I\nLeave a blank row between the category Table and the dates.\nNext, using the instructions in step 5, convert the category input range (A7:H12) to a Table object. It isn't necessary, but formatting and updating will be easier. (Your formats won't match the figure, so don't worry about that.)\nWith the category Table object selected, click the contextual Design tab and check the Total Row option in the Table Style Options group. Select Sum from the dropdown added to B13. Copy that function to C13:H13. Figure I shows the finished category Table input range.\nBy making the range a Table, you can easily add or delete new categories, but each category requires only one row per pay period. You can add a new or delete an existing category, but you won't duplicate a category.\n7. Add project input range\nNow you're ready to add the project input range, which includes the project data validation control I mentioned earlier. Enter days of the week, Sunday through Saturday in B15:H15\u2014leaving a blank row between the two input ranges. To add the projects data validation control, select A16 and do the following:\nClick the Data tab, click Data Validation in the Data Tools group, and then select the Data Validation option from the dropdown list. In the resulting dialog, choose List from the Allow dropdown. In the Source control, enter =ProjectList (Figure J), the defined name you gave to the project list Table object in step 5. If you like, click the Error Alert tab, and enter a meaningful error message. This step isn't necessary for the sheet to work, but your users will appreciate the information. Click OK.\nFigure J\nCreate a data validation control that lists the projects.\nIn the last step, you converted the category input range to a Table. Do this again, converting the project input range (A15:H16) to a Table (with headers). Then, enable the Total Row as you did for the category Table.\nYou may or may not need a project row each week. You could have 0 rows or several, depending on the number of projects you worked on that pay period. The current project list has only two projects, so you'd have up to two rows for the given pay period. If you add a new project next week, you might have up to three rows in this Table. As you add projects using the data validation list, the Table, shown in Figure K, expands. As before, don't worry about Table formats just yet.\nFigure K\nThis Table will adjust to the number of projects you work on during the pay period.\n8. Category and project totals\nTo add a column of category totals, select I8, click AutoSum, highlight B8:H8 and press Enter. Change the default header to Category Totals and increase the column width. Repeat this process to add project totals to the project Table. Be sure to highlight row 16 (AutoSum might try to sum values in column I).\n9. Grand daily totals\nPresently, you have category and project weekly totals in column I and daily subtotals in row 13 and 17. You don't have a daily grand total. Insert two blank rows between row 5 and 7. Select B7 and enter the expression\n=Table4[[#Totals],[Sunday]]+Table3[[#Totals],[Sunday]]\nCopy it to C7:H7. Instead of entering those long references, you could click B15 and B19.\nFigure L shows the timesheet after disabling the gridlines and applying Table formats consistently to both Table objects. It's a bit odd to have grand totals at the top of the sheet, but this position allows the project Table to grow with impunity.\nFigure L\nThe complete timesheet.\n10. Business rules\nAt this point, your sheet is functional, but there are some things you might want to add. If blank cells are problematic for your accounting system, add zeros to the input ranges in the category and project Table objects. To do so, enter a 0 into an empty cell and copy it to the Clipboard. Then, select B10:H14 (the category input range) and press F5. In the resulting dialog, click Special. Select the Blanks option and click OK. Press Ctrl+v to paste the 0 from the Clipboard into the selected blank cells. Repeat this task for the project Table's input range, B18:H18.\nUsers can delete the 0s and accidentally leave blanks, so you might want to consider a conditional formatting rule that highlights blank cells:\n=ISBLANK(inputrange)\nAs you add new projects to the project Table, the rule highlights the entire new row because those cells are blank.\nMost companies don't allow overtime in the same day that you use comp, sick, or vacation time. You can use the following conditional formatting rule to highlight the values in B12:H14 when the overtime value in row 11 is greater than 0 and the corresponding comp, or sick, or vacation value is greater than 0:\n=AND(B$11>0, OR(B$12>0,B$13>0,B$14>0))\nIt won't fix the problem, but it will alert your user that a problem exists.\nUsing the sheet\nEach pay period, the user will open the template file and rename it to reflect the current pay period. It's not the only way, of course, but it's the easiest way. Employees can submit a printed copy or the electronic file.\nFigure M shows hours accrued for the work week beginning March 25, 2018. Harkins worked a total of 44 hours; 31 in fixed categories and 13 on specific projects. As you can see, there's a problem on Thursday because Harkins is claiming 2 hours of overtime and 2 hours of sick time. The only way to resolve this error is to remove either the overtime or the sick time.\nFigure M\nUsing the sheet.\nThere's one limitation worth noting: If you work 10 hours on a single project in the same day, you can't identify two of those hours as overtime. Enter 10 in the project row and let payroll staff work out the overtime when applying rates.\nNormally you'd protect the sheet before distributing the workbook, but you can't easily protect a sheet with an expanding Table object. For better or worse, you'll have to trust users to be somewhat competent with this timesheet. They always have the template to start fresh, if the worst happens.\nGet more great Office tips and tricks delivered to your inbox. Sign up for TechRepublic's Microsoft Weekly newsletter.
